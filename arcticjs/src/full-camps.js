Almost half of the population live in Ulaanbaatar /about 1.5 million/. If the virus spreads in Mongolia, it is very dangerous for the Mongols. The price of the mask has been repeatedly increased in Ulaanbaatar due to the spread of corona virus. So I'm donating a mask to the poor and orphans. I hope you will support me to protect Mongols\u00a0 from corona virus. Not only Mongolia, let's keep our world safe together!

Many more cities have been asked to institute a quarantine to slow\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0the progression.   * There are many people, mainly foreigners and especially foreign students who are in difficult situation.  * Work, goods and services are in short supply or non existent.  * Mask are so hard to come by. However, if you have to travel by transportation or go shopping, you cant enter\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0without them, so this magnifies the problem.  I want to use these funds to provide mask and money to those who are not earning an income because businesses are shuttered, so people can eat and move around.\u00a0  There are so many who because they cant work, cant leave,cant buy food and are slowly facing a dire situation.  We hope you can help to make life a little less stressful for those who are really limited.\u00a0  We do hope this will pass soon, but it will take months for things to get back to normal.\u00a0  If you need more information, or have any questions, please feel free to contact me through this platform!

Up till 12am January 24, 4535 cases have been confirmed in China, and the number is doubling every day. 106 patients have died from the virus. The live update of the disease could be found here:  https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html.  School breaks are extended, public transportations are curtailed, and Wuhan, the origin of the virus, is quarantined.   Doctors in Hubei (the province of Wuhan) are working overtime in this Holiday season, but shortages in surgical supplies put them in extreme dangers of exposure to the virus.

    "description": " Summary  An outbreak of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus from Wuhan, China, has caused more than 100 deaths in China, with nearly 8,000 cases confirmed in the China. Corona virus has not yet been reported in Sierra Leone, even though there is a strong ties with China. The virus is spreading worldwide and cases are now being confirmed in Africa. The World Health Organization has declared it a world health emergency. Help and support are urgently needed to fight the spread of this fatal infection and to prevent it from becoming a global epidemic. Our goal is to save the lives of our school children, their families and communities.   Challenge  Containment and treatment of the pneumonia-like virus is critical. The novel corona-virus is spreading rapidly. Hundreds of Sierra Leonean do business and studies in China, and may be unknowing carriers and spreaders of the virus during their movement or when Chinese ships dock in the country. With little education, the virus can spread quickly with destructive impact to our people. The need for education while this is still not the case is urgent and the time is now!   Solution  Donations to this fund will support awareness efforts and services before communities will be affected. Funds donated will be used: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0 To produce and distribute thousands of educational flyers and leaflets, bulletin boards to schools and communities including farmers and petty traders \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0 Conduct school and small community educational meetings \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0 Social media, Radio and TV discussions \u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0Purchase and distribution of Soaps, Sanitizers and water bottles to students and schools, water buckets and cups to schools and communities, sanitary pads to girls during menstruation \u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0Emergency arrangement provided for a suspected carrier  \u00a0Your donation will reach thousands of local school children and their communities on how to detect symptoms, what to do in order to prevent transmission and how to practice health precautions when a case starts to appear.    Long-Term Impact  We believe that our organization is deeply rooted in local communities and we are in the best position to raise awareness and sensitize the populace to work together to help stop the spread of this deadly virus and any other crises. By funding this campaign, it will have a potential to build stronger response capacity, to face future outbreaks. We will post reports about how funds have been used to donors. The health and wellness of our school children and their communities is paramount. With very high education and awareness, if an outbreak happens, the virus spread will be contained and damage will be minimal.",

I must be very clear and honest with you all, but this virus is far MORE dangerous than the SARS or MERS Virus, since no cure has yet been found. Within the last couple of days, the death toll of this virus at first was at 60, and recently has risen to over 200 deaths.\u00a0 According to news sources like, CNN, New York Times, and to the local San Francisco Chronicle, the CDC and other health officials fear that the death rate is only increasing at this point.

Not all of us are able to deal with this unforeseen epidemic in china, for it has hit as a surprise. The world health organisation declaring this to be serious is really scary, so to stay safe people have to avoid outdoor activities and exposure, stocking up food and other necessities is the way to go.

Raise funds of 20,000AUD to purchase N95 masks and medical protective clothing locally in Sydney and ship for the doctors and nurses. They have raised request for help! Our hearts with the Doctors and Nurses in Hubei!  As per the request of GoFundMe, I am providing more details about this campaign.  My name is Colin Hu (Zhichao). I am a Chinese expat working in Australia. My home town is Jingzhou, Hubei, a city around 200km away from Wuhan. Maybe as not as so known to people in Australia, Jingzhou is suffering from the corona virus greatly. Til today (9 Feb), the city has 941 confirmed cases, with 56 added to the list today. My sister works in Jingzhou No. 1 People's Hospital as a doctor in Department of Respiration. She has been in the isolated wards for the confirmed patients for the last 10 days. I am encourage by her and all the medical workers to have this fundraising to provide medical protective masks and\u00a0 coveralls for them. The donation will go to Jingzhou No.1 People's Hospital through Hubei Charity General Society (official receipient).  We have purchased already 1304 pcs of DuPont Tyvek 800J coveralls and we are still seeking available stuffs from Australia and US. We now have a Wechar group and volunteers have been assigned to different tasks like sourcing materials, logistics arrangements like cargo booking, custom clearance, dispatch and others, while also work as team.  The 1st batch of medical coveralls have been shipped to China on 30 Jan, and arrived in the hospital on early morning 2 Feb. We have received appreciation and gratitude from the hospital and Hubei Charity General Society.  Thank you all and we are still fighting against the corona virus.  We will keep you updated.",

This Gofundme page is setup to help fundraising for purchasing medical supplies for Wuhan hospitals, doctors, nurses,\u00a0 healthcare workers,\u00a0 medical microbiologists, volunteers in Wuhan, China whose currently fighting to save all these innocent lives. Yes, we know the virus spread too quickly for anyone to react. We know the cause of the virus and we know there are human responsibilities in this BUT not everyone deserves to be infected or die.\u00a0  Wuhan was once my home when I was a child and I still have family there. Unfortunately, 2 of my close family members including\u00a0 a healthcare worker are currently isolated in hospital in Wuhan suffering from the coronavirus. We are lucky that they received treatment. We are lucky that we had these healthcare workers to save them! We are grateful, and we are heart broken at the same time, because we know how serious this is and we are still experiencing the possibilities of loosing close family members we want to help! And we need your help! We want every doctor, nurse, healthcare workers, medical microbiologist, volunteer, and patient to go home safely! I am lucky, I live in USA currently, I am lucky that I did not get stuck in Wuhan city because I no longer live in Wuhan. I am lucky I have so much resources! But whose there to help them, and the true heroes?  Currently, my cousin who was a reporter in Wuhan is in direct contact with many hospitals bypassing government or other organizations. Yes, we want to make sure that every pieces of supply gets delivered directly to the hospitals! We need to help and protect the frontline fighters whose risking everything to save our family and my home.\u00a0  Due to Wuhan city and many other cities lockdowns, shortage of supplies, increased pricing on these supplies set lots of restrictions and limitation. In Wuhan, China, we raised about $10000 and purchased only 600 pieces of protected clothing delivered to assigned hospitals.\u00a0 This is truly NOT ENOUGH...Therefore, our family decided to connect together at this tough time to raise more fundings to help even if the prices are expensive...these medical supplies are life savers!\u00a0  Right now, flights no longer go to Wuhan and due to varies of other reasons, even if we ship supplies to Wuhan, it does not get distributed to the needed hospitals. So we have to purchase and gather the supplies in China! To make sure we get the required high quality supplies, we need more funds to purchase them. We will guarantee to purchase the medical supplies and deliver them directly to each hospitals that we work with. We already completed round 1 so we know this works! That's why we want to continue!          Many people are in lockdown in their community in Wuhan, Hubei,\u00a0 other areas in China so we have to depend on these warm hearted volunteers to help us move and deliver these items to hospitals! We need to protect them too!!!!!\u00a0       And IF you have resources or supplies in Wuhan and China, please please contact me and I can link you up with my cousin. During this time, please stop the discrimination to Wuhan people. We know human beings made mistakes, other organizations did too but we should stop blaming and hating, we should stick together to help! We need to have a kind heart and generous actions to support! Even if is just a little help, even if you could just help me share the page, we truly appreciated! And we are thankful for everyone whose helping and praying to get through this tough times!\u00a0  We know there's lots of different voices, political views, fake supplies etc. BUT let's put that all aside and just focus on one purpose, HELP and SUPPORT Wuhan and save innocent lives! Inside Wuhan City, we\u00a0 truly are still in urgent need of supplies!  Please find the news links to see more details about the coronavirus.   https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/01/asia/coronavirus-wuhan-discrimination-intl-hnk/index.html     https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-we-know-about-the-wuhan-virus-11579716128       https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/    Please contact me through Gofundme if you have resources or supplies in China!\u00a0  I would like to thank everyone in advance!

Until less than a month, the epidemic had spread to more than half of the continent, and new coronaviruses were found in 23 provinces of China. There were 213 deaths in China and 9,692 confirmed cases. In this serious situation, the Hong Kong government has not only failed to improve the measures to respond to the epidemic, has not provided enough medical supplies, and was recently discovered that the government has a stock of 10 million masks, but it has not properly distributed them to the public, causing people panic.

Changing everything... forever. We were forced to leave our home, our people, our comforts. We did what we had to. We listened to minds, rather than our hearts.  We set out with a \u201cNaaseh Venishmah\u201d state of mind, just following orders. We began our journey in Combodia, Southeast Asia, only planning to be there for a nice and explorative seven days. But as the saying goes; \u201cman plans and god laughs\u201d. To our complete surprise, we are compelled to continue traveling and wandering through the world for at least another month. As some may find this as a blessing in disguise, we are in utter dismay. We miss our home in China, we are hungry, and we are broke. We were thrown this curve ball, leaving us homeless in a third workout country.  Please, we strongly urge u to generously open ur wallets to us money and help us get through this. Your donation will go to an outstanding cause. It will be used to fund our \u201ckosher\u201d food, nights out , and all our bathing suits.  With much thanks, Rivkah g \u2764",

I\u2019m such an ordinary person quiet on social, I never thought I would be so desperate and devastated to draft a letter for help with face covering in tears! This January with the  outbreak of Coronavirus  at Wuhan my hometown\u2764, I realized and is experiencing such a life-threatening moment for my family who are infected with the virus and hundreds of thousands of people are suffering this novel virus with pneumonia and hard to breath problem (China\u2019s number is less than what\u2019s real). They are on the fringe of fighting the virus through their own Immune Systems and Antivirus/antibacterial medicines with the city under quarantine, but the  sad thing is they lack medical supplies of masks, goggles, protection suits  to prevent the virus  from transmission to more people at the hospitals and communities at Wuhan  (even they also lack medicines, since those are prescription drugs there is no way we can purchase). Even though lots of people are trying to help in this matter including myself and my husband, there still lots of things we need to do and lots of supplies we need to send to China. As you may know Alibaba, Taobao those big online stores in China is sold out of masks, goggles, we are purchasing  supplies here at US to send back to China . Since its two of us on our part, we realized its wiser and better if we can collect help from the humanitarian society to help accelerate the process. If you are there and willing to help this effort, any dollar or connection with those supplies is welcomed! I attached all those first-hand information and the real moments of my friends circle on Wechat (a Chinese chat tool) to show you what\u2019s really going on. And with all the dollars raised I\u2019ll  buy those supplies  and reply this crowdfunding with the  purchasing sheets and shipping information  to show how your money goes. Please also  send prayers  for Wuhan, I believe God can hear us! It\u2019s near the time to re-examine ourselves and the world around us. 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Who I am: Xinyu born at Wuhan, have been living at US since 2012 Fall came here for Graduate degree  2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where I\u2019m from: Wuchang District, Wuhan City, China  3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Relationship with parties raising funds: Family friends community hospitals in Wuhan. My father is hospitalized at Wuhan University Renmin Hospital, my grandpa is at Wuhan Tianyou Hospital. My mom and grandma currently don\u2019t have any spots available at the Hospital.  4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Fund spent: will all be used for purchasing supplies like masks, goggles, protection suit and ship back to Wuhan.",

    "description": "As of 2nd Feb, the confirmed cases of Corona Virus Patients worldwide are approaching 15,000 fast, with possible further escalation and outbreak explosion in next 5-7 days. One of the bigger problem in China now is the lack of medical supplies. The doctors, nurses and patients at the front line hospitals are running out of Medical Coveralls, Surgical Masks, Face Shields and Protective Goggles. The protective gear most in demand is the protective clothes (Medical Coveralls). It is so crucial to protect the medical staff and it takes so much longer to manufacture. This is not to mention the broader community in China are not able to buy any of those. There is also ad appearing in Chinese social media and online market to buy back used face masks to recycle, which has upset lots of people. I am not here to ask for your donation. Of course you are most welcome if you feel generous. We have raised some money offline and the problem is the purchasing channel has been dried up. We don\u2019t know where we can buy these medical supplies. I am asking for help, if you are a medical equipment supplier, or if you know anyone who works in the industry and willing to help, to get in touch with me. I have listed the items that are desperately in need. I am asking your help to prioritise our order, work overtime and manufacturing the goods as soon as possible. Again, we are not asking you to donate them, we will pay for the goods. We will then post them directly to the front line hospitals in Hubei Province in China, NOT VIA ANY NGOs. Thank you very much!

Our mission is to use Chinese culture as a carrier to promote social progress and build a spiritual home for Chinese Americans. Our three focuses are based on love, inherit culture, and focusing. The first focus is love, which means we\u2019ll be organizing social events-such as fundraising, donation, teaching children living in hills--in order to spread the love to the community. The second is based on culture inheriting. As Chinese Americans, we also have projects and activities to promote Chinese culture and art. Thirdly, we will focus our spirit and mission, creating a welcoming and helpful environment/community for Chinese American students. In the future, we will be reaching out to different states and China to help plan trips, college applications, and internships.   On behalf of our Spark organization, our goal is to help Wuhan, China and we have the responsibility to help those who have been affected by this deadly virus, which is circulating all around the world. According to the New York Times, in Wuhan, there are already more than 14,000 people affected, and more than 300 have died from this severe virus. Not only in China, but the United States so far has shown 8 cases with one of which hits in the bay area. With the severity of this disease, we want to help by holding a Go-Fund-Me fundraiser to provide supplies for the affected people in Wuhan and their scarcity in medical supplies.   We will beat Coronavirus!

    "description": "  The novel coronavirus outbreak is spreading quickly in Wuhan, China and beyond. A scarcity of critical medical supplies such as N95 face masks, protective goggles, protective suits and other medical grade equipment is contributing to the increased number of people, including health professionals, exposed to this dangerous disease. Death tolls are rising and we must act fast!  As Chinese across Toronto Ontario Canada, we are reaching out to all of our communities, their friends and families to ask for a hand in aiding the efforts of Chinese medical professionals to combat this virus.   We have launched a fundraising for the City of Wuhan to prevent cross-infection and curb the spreading of the coronavirus. Funds raised will be used to buy necessary supplies for epidemic prevention or to be donated to other charity organizations to fight the coronavirus directly.   We will announce the fundraising amount in real time, and personally ensure that all the funds received will be used to purchase the materials needed to prevent the epidemic. We will announce the progress and whereabouts of materials and fundraising every day.   Thank you for all your support and contribution! Every penny counts!

As WHO declares the Coronavirus outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern, our task became even harder, as a lot of medical suppliers and distributors now post limitation on purchases. If any of you know NGOs that could help with the consumable medical supplies, please feel free to contact us at info@nywhu.org. We would be more than happy to discuss a feasible plan together. We truly believe, we would defeat this outbreak if we fight together. Warmest Regards, Wuhan University Alumni Association of Greater New York. JANUARY 30, 2020by WHU Alumni,\u00a0Organizer Dear donors, Our medical supplies reached the front line of Coronarius fight in Wuhan. Please see attached some pictures and confirmation example from a hospital. We plan to ship out another 120,002 count of medical supplies today with Flight\u2026Read more JANUARY 29, 2020by WHU Alumni,\u00a0Organizer Great News: After long hours of transportation from Shanghai to Wuhan, our first pack of consumable medical supplies arrived at 3 different local hospitals in Wuhan. Please below some of the pictures and our order history. Government support The two institutes that discovered Shuanghuanglian's alleged ability to \"inhibit\" the coronavirus are both state-run bodies. The Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica is under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), a top government think tank. The Wuhan Institute of Virology is also\u00a0administered by the CAS\u00a0and is among the country's most advanced virus research laboratories. Thousands of people have been sickened by a new coronavirus, called 2019-nCoV, in at least a dozen countries, including the US. Coronaviruses attack the respiratory system, sometimes targeting the cells deep within the lungs. Only seven, including 2019-nCoV, SARS, and MERS, have evolved to infect humans.",

    "description": " Hello Everyone!  My name is Tina and I am a Chinese born Australian. I was born and raised by the very mothering land of China and as I feel the need to do something to help my motherland to overcome this terrifying Crisis!  As I work in the health care industry for the past 12 years, I travel to Chinese hospitals often, and I have a vast amount of channels to receive most up to date news. It is now WuHan hospitals that are most in demand of these medical equipments, there are more than 30k confirmed diagnosis, and much more infected. The hospitals in Wuhan are already OUT OF surgical masks and protective gowns, unfortunately, the government is also in shortage.  Your donations will be spent to purchasing N95 masks, procedural masks that has 99% bacterial filtration rate, and medical/surgical gowns which I have already sourced from. With the existing amount funded, I have already purchased (out of my own pocket for now until gofundme allows for withdrawal) 1100 procedural masks, 100 N95 masks and 50 surgical gowns. Note that there are still 350 gowns, 900 N95 masks and 4900 procedural masks available for purchase before they get sold out (which will happen in less than a couple of days), I need your support to ensure that our Chinese front line fighters are protected while they serve their patients.\u00a0  My friend will then bring back all these gears in person from Sydney to Beijing on 12th Feb and that is when the fundraising will stop.   Chinese Doctors and Nurses are currently treating tens of thousands of infected patients using recycled (washed in disinfectant solution) surgical masks, and lab coat\u2026\u2026\u2026. as there are NO MORE protective gear left for use!  So many of them are infected EVERYDAY, and then they go home and infect their family members. Every time I read a story, I am in tears\u2026\u2026\u00a0  Please chip in and help out to the first line Hero and Angels!  I thank you very much in advance! Tina  To update on the most recent progression of this activity (07Feb2020) - I have successfully sourced 1100 Procedural masks and 180 N95/P2 masks ready for shipping. - I am awaiting to receive 50 surgical gowns and am looking for more, if anyone has resources for medical equipments, please reach out to me on 0450225004.   UPDATE on 10Feb2020:   Thank you all so very much my dearest Chinese brothers and sister, together, we have made a total of almost 9000 over the past 5 days!! This is unreal!!  As many of you would have noticed, that the donation was disabled as of last night. The reason for this is because we have saturated existing stocks that we could get hold of, and the campaign needs to close prior to 11th Feb as all stocks will depart to Beijing on 13Feb.\u00a0  Having said that, I have obtained 2 more potential resources as of last night, and with successful establishment of both connections, and confirmed supply, the Campaign maybe reopened again, so please watch the space.  Wish me luck :)  All the very best to Chinese civilians...and hope that the outbreak will not be worsened with the end of the holiday period, today. ..",

    "description": "Hi All- as you may have heard, the China Coronavirus has reached over 31K cases as of today. This 2019-nCoV is easily transmitted via human-to-human interaction. As a Chinese, I feel so devastated everytime when I hear that another family friend passed away or another friend got infected. My mom works in the hospital and has to put her life on the line to reuse expired face masks everyday. This is why so many health care workers got infected. The infected areas are urged to use medical supplies such as face masks and protective clothes. This is now the only way to slow down the virus spread. We would like to share this conquering 2019-nCOV campaign with you  https://www.gofundme.com/f/ConqueringCOV  Your donation will be collected and used to purchase protective gear to help those infected areas and stop the virus from spreading worldwide. Your support is well appreciated.  To tell you a bit more about our fund: We are student organization at Rice Business School in Houston, TX. This Campaign has been approved and supported by Rice Jones Business School since Feb 5th 2020. We have contacted the alumni initiated group in South California that collects the fund from top universities in US to support the coronavirus in China. Attached the charity group information in the picture below. The fund will be directly transferred to the group mentioned above. The procurement team will purchase the healthcare supplies and ship back to China in the next few days once the money is received.",

    "description": "I don\u2019t know where to start... it was the night if Thursday, Febuary 6th. I was hosting a medium sized gathering at my home in Narragansett, RI. Everything was going fine, and then it happened. A drunk girl smashed into my beloved corona sign, ending its life prematurely. The neon tubes shattered, and the palm tree shined its last light. Heartbroken would be an understatement. \n\nCan you find it in your heart to make up for this girls mistakes? Any amount helps, we need to get this sign fixed so that our house can be restored to its former glory. While money may ease the pain, nothing could ever fix the loss that all of us here at 9 feel in our hearts. Have a blessed day.",

    "description": "October 16, 2019 everything changed for Robert Corona, loving husband to Rachelle and father to Rae, Joey, Elijah and Nessa when they found out he had\u00a0 Stage IV Colon Cancer  at the age of 36.\u00a0\u00a0 From that moment Robert has said he will beat this! Robert has a large extended family and friends who we know will be right beside him loving and fighting with him!   \u00a0Hitting the ground running they decided to start curative treatment as fast as they could. With 3 months of chemotherapy, surgery \u00a0and another 3 months of Chemotherapy. He and his family will need our support and love as he embarks on this journey. There are many ways we can rally around Robert and his incredible family: prayers, meals, love and financial support.\u00a0    This means giving up a few things He loves and enjoys for the near future, like his job and little league. Robert has been a loyal hardworking employee for Berryessa Union School District for the last 18 years, a job which he has excelled at. He is well respected and loved at his job even being awarded employee of the year for all his hard work.\u00a0    Robert has since stepped down from being President of Berryessa Little League a passion of his, since his diagnosis.Robert has been an active part of little league since he first coached his daughter Rae in 2007 at North Valley. \u00a0In 2008 he started coaching for Berryessa Little League where he coached all of his kids, his nephews and countless children. \u00a0His loving sprit was always noticed on the field from racing the kids around the bases with 60 of his work keys clipped to his belt. Maintaining the fields for the league and at countless board meetings. If you didn\u2019t see him coaching or working on the field you could find him umpiring games .\u00a0    Robert is one of the easiest people to love and friend in minutes. \u00a0He is the only person I know who makes friends every single place he goes. Robert can walk into a party not knowing one person and by the end of the night he has made friends with everyone there making plans to see them again. With his outgoing and joking personality who wouldn\u2019t want to be his new friend. He would also give the shirt off his back and if you need any help he\u2019s the first to volunteer without you even asking. \u00a0He has the ability to make you feel as if you\u2019ve known him for years even after only just minutes of knowing him.    Robert also loves his wife Rachelle who he has been with for 20 years. He\u2019s a family man through and through You see that love and devotion in his 4 children. \u00a0His family is the most important thing to him. \u00a0Cancer will not stop him from doing anything and everything he can for them.   Anyone who knows Robert knows how loved he makes everyone around him feel. Through this journey Robert, Rachelle and kids will need our help. Robert and Rachelle will both be out of work during this (Robert being the main provider)and have lots of added expenses with lots of doctors visits, tests ,medicines special diet, gas and care along with their regular monthly expenses. All donations will go directly towards these things. Please help us make their next few months a little easier with one less thing to worry about. \u00a0Every little bit helps and we can\u2019t thank you enough in advance for your love and support.\u00a0    The road to recovery will have its ups and downs but we know that we will all rally around Robert, Rachelle and kids with any and all support we can give! \u00a0    Remember rule #1 from Coach Robert. \u00a0Have fun and always give 100%!!\u00a0     THEY WILL BEAT THIS!  \u00a0   If you\u2019d like to help support them in any other way please email chellelarae430@gmail.com   #CRONASTRONG \u00a0 #YOURFIGHTISOURFIGHT",

    "description": "English version:\n\n     My name is Quang Pham, a sophomore in high school who has recently moved to the USA to study.\n     As you are already aware of, the whole world has been concerned about the newly rise yet dangerous virus called coronavirus (Covid-19), which creates lung problems. Originated in Wuhan, China, the virus has spread throughout every continent, infecting more than 75000 people with 2009 killed as of February 19, 2020. The World Health Organization has declared the virus \u201ca global threat.\u201d And we need to help those in need of basic medical supplies to prevent the spread of the virus.\n     I want to address this issue to my home country, Vietnam, which declared the novel coronavirus outbreak an epidemic on February 01 with 16 people infected so far. Here, although many people are aware of the disease and try to take precautions, there are some \u2013 especially THE POOR - who do not have the fair chance to access the most basic safety. Because of the virus, the cost of face masks has risen dramatically; worse still, they are out of stock in many areas due to different reasons. The situation creates a huge disadvantage for the needy. I am organizing this fund to buy masks from the U.S. and give them to the people in poor areas in Vietnam which are currently facing a huge shortage of masks.\n     My goal is to get $2,500 for this fund; and we need to act quickly since the price of masks is changing constanly due to the shortage. The money will then be sent to a doctor that I have contact with to buy masks; then the masks will be sent back to some friends of mine in Vietnam who will help me distribute them to poor people. To start, I will donate $200 and I hope you will act quickly as well. Thank you for your consideration.

    "description": "\n My name is Michael Gray and I'm homeless here in Nashville. A few weeks ago a tornado hit Nashville killing 8 homeless people as it tore through the Jefferson Street bridge homeless camp, destroying all the tents there and displacing a lot of people. Most of the resources we relied on to get by were now focused on the victims of the tornado who lost their homes; and rightfully so. \n \n\n Now we have the flu pandemic and we still have not recovered from the tornado. Most of the resources we depend on closed down because of the flu and we have been unable to get needed supplies now for weeks. The homeless camp I stay in has a lot of people with mental health issues who are homeless by no fault of their own. Most are unable to head into town to find help even if there was a place to go. I have been here for almost 6 months helping make sure everyone has what they need and it is now very difficult. \n \n\n We need supplies. Mostly water and food but we also need propane for cooking and for heat at night and batteries and flashlights. Essential items that we cannot get by without. Other problems most people don't realize we have being homeless are things like money to wash bedding and clothing and to purchase shoes, socks and new tents. If it wasn't for a few amazing people that have sent food and water, I don't know how we would have gotten by so far.\n \n\n If you can help, we need it. I would be able to purchase and distribute supplies where they are needed most if we had some funding, so please donate a few dollars if you are able. If not, please check on your neighbors even if you don't know them. Or ask someone who looks distressed if they need help. Because it's the right thing to do and a small act of kindness can travel through the hearts of dozens of people, and change the world. \n \n\n Thank you, \n \n\n Michael Gray - Founder of H.E.A.L. \"Helping Escape Addictive Lifestyles\" 615-541-3661",

We have no place to go and no money to move if we had to leave. Had to stop Lyft driving which is my only source of income to protect my 82 yo mother who lives with me. No income for two or three weeks will really hurt our already drastic situation. If it goes longer than 3 weeks I am sure things will be so bad for us and many other families. Trying to get assistance to keep us in the house we are renting, but I know the landlords need to pay their bills too. Any help would be gratefully appreciated.\u00a0\nMy 82 yo mother who is in fragile health came to live with me in 2016 to make things easier on her and give her a better place to live and enjoy the rest of her life. She has survived breast cancer and is now needing new dentures but the dentist has major concerns that mom's lower jaw is too thin to get new dentures. So she is waiting to get into an oral surgeon to see if there is anything they can do. She has been on antibiotics to clear up a chest cold or infection in her sinuses that makes her cough and labors her breathing. \nMom's recent pain in the area where her breast was removed was examined by a doctor who ordered more tests. The tech that did her ultrasound said that she thought everything was looking okay. Hopefully the doctor will review the test and agree.",

    "description": "\n As most of you know I recently moved to Vietnam to start a new chapter of my life. \u00a0Once my father passed away I knew even more-so that this change was needed in my life.\n \n\n It\u2019s something I was so desperate to do not only to change my life for the better, \u00a0but to make myself and my family proud. Each day I wake up thankful tobe here, thankful that I went through with this dream and continue to make my dad proud.\u00a0\n \n\n Since the CoronaVirus decided to appear, not only has the world come to a stop still but also my mind and mental health as abruptly come crashing down. So much so I\u2019ve contemplating giving up this dream completely, so much so that Im sleep depriving myself, so much so that anxiety and panic attacks have become second nature. Then I think about leaving again, something I know will make me feel like an even bigger failure. During this outbreak it has left me uncertain of how I might continue to not only have a roof over my head, \u00a0but cover basic needs such as food and water. The virus has stopped all schools from opening, which in turn means us teachers are left with nothing. As it stands the schools are not due to open any time soon which does mean basic living necessities will be something I no longer have access to. Food and water will no longer be a viable option, let alone having somewhere to live.\u00a0\n \n\n  All I\u2019m asking for is help, in any way shape or form. Every penny counts, and I will use whatever funds are raised to cover living expenses as well as manage to feed and water myself. Any further funds that I manage to raise will goto a charity that helps individuals in crisis situations. I don\u2019t expect anyone to donate however if you choose to, just know that i am beyond grateful. I will forever be truly thankful \u2665\ufe0f",

    "description": "Wuhan, located in Hubei province, was hit with a devastating virus at the beginning of January. Since then, the numbers of those infected and died have grown exponentially, killing over 600 people with another 30,000 infected. The effects of the novel coronavirus are very evident throughout China seen with roads being blocked, major cities being quarantined, and hospitals being inundated with thousands of cases. This surplus of patients has led to an extreme shortage of supplies that are necessary for the doctors to treat the sick, including face masks, medical goggles, and hazmat suits. As this virus is relatively new, not much is known about it yet making it unpredictable and threatening.  This is why we need your help. There are over 98 million people living in the epicenter of this outbreak with no way out, making it an extremely dangerous situation for them. Even a donation of $5 is sufficient to provide aid to those on the frontlines battling the coronavirus. I have partnered with the ACP Foundation and the North Texas Hubei Association who will be able to ensure supplies can be shipped to the Hubei province as soon as possible. All proceeds will be donated towards North Texas Hubei Association who has sellers to purchase the supplies from (face masks, gloves, sanitation suits, etc.) to distribute to various hospitals in the Hubei province. This association has already delivered 10,000 medical gowns, 35,000 face masks, and 1,875 protective goggles to Hubei Province. The situation in China is worsening and they need all the aid they can receive. Please support us as we join ranks with the citizens of Wuhan and fight against the Novel Coronavirus. If you have any questions, feel free to send me an email ( gianna6818@gmail.com  or Angela Huang at  angela.huang13@gmail.com ).\u6b66\u6c49\u52a0\u6cb9!",

    "description": "      Hello. I'm \"Jae Hoon\" living in Korea. I am poor at English.  So if you use a language machine, please understand.   Thank you.  Currently, the Wnhan coronavirus is a very large threat worldwide. It's more dangerous than the Ebola virus, which was deadly years ago. The infection is very high, and today in China, it's a deadly evolution of human-to-human infections. I didn't take it seriously because I thought it was happening in China. However, over time, many felt infected and felt that they did not look at the current situation.  I investigated, but the situation was serious.  I wanted to help China and the country of the infected. But I do not have the knowledge of making vaccines. Currently, China and countries with infected people are said to be very short of masks and hand sanitizers.  Currently, foreign traders have purchased large quantities of high-grade masks in Korea. They sell at very high prices in their own country.  The cost of a Korean mask is $ 0.25. They sell at least $ 3 to up to $ 6 in their home country. The average income of a family in China is $500 a month.  It is very unfortunate and sad.  Currently, some parts of China are isolated when they are rich or poor or not wearing masks. If the number of infected continues to increase, all countries will be in danger.  So I want to help China and the infected country and the future. I will make a mask factory with my money. I will send relief goods to every country that needs a mask for free. But I have money that only makes factories.   Start fund-raising for mask parts purchase   Please.    I do not want the situation of Wuhan Coronavirus to get worse. And help people who are poor and cannot buy masks. I will build the factory early. And I'll make a mask and send it to many countries as a relief Help me. For the country and the world. If help is difficult. Tell your friends and family about this.      Thank you for reading this long article.",

    "description": "Novel Coronavirus(2019-nCoV) is a new respiratory virus first identified in Wuhan, a big transportation hub in China. The virus is highly contagious and it's appearance during the peak of Chinese New Year has allowed it to spread to other cities. It has now passed SARS in deaths, and is several times more infectious in its spread.  As of February 9, 2020, according to the government's report in China, 40,710 people have been diagnosed with coronavirus, 23,589 people are suspected of being infected and 910 people have died.   These numbers increase every day, and there have been no signs of slowing down. It is threatening the lives of hundreds of millions not only in China, but around the world. China estimates that the peak of the infection rate will be around mid-February, the most difficult time has yet to come. In all Chinese cities, schools are delayed and all public facilities are shut down.  Due to the unexpected outbreak, hundreds of millions of Chinese people's lives are at stake.  Items such as: masks, goggles and protective suits which are used to combat the spread of this disease are high in demand but low in supply. We need your help to fight against this devastating illness.  We're working with Chicago NW suburban Chinese Christian Church which is in connection with a Wuhan Church to organize the purchase and shipment to the hospitals in need. All money raised is going to be used to purchase those medical supplies for doctors in Wuhan. With your help, we will make sure that doctors will have access to needed supplies in order to prevent the spread of the disease and save more lives.",

Due to the Japanese govt's attempt to prevent the rapid outbreak of the Corona virus they have closed all schools for an indefinite time which will certainly lead to financial hardships for Paul during this time. It is my intention to attempt to facilitate financial relief for him through this campaign until the schools reopen.\u00a0  I understand that millions are being affected by this current crisis. I am stepping up to help meet the needs of a dear friend who I know is personally affected by the Corona virus outbreak. Many thanks to any who can contribute to this campaign.",

    "description": "With the continued epidemic's coming from China,  SARS-CoV ,  Bird Flu  (H5N1),  Middle East Respiratory Syndrome  (MERS) and now  COVID-19  we need a device that can protect people from airborne viruses.\u00a0 This would also help eliminate the yearly flu, when used with proper precautions, such as washing your hands.\u00a0 I have already developed, patented and tested the cartridge idea, but now need to make it a reality for personal use.\u00a0 I started working on the idea when the SARS outbreak happened, but as all great ideas, personal life gets in the way.\u00a0   The original idea was for a room sized device that could protect a large area.\u00a0 I called it the UVBioClean.   This is still valid but the cost to manufacture is higher and there is still a higher chance that it would not filter the virus in the placed room, or in travel before it could make contact with someone. For this reason, I would like to take the same principles and design a small personal device, that could be carried (similar to cell phone), and could be used everywhere. I need your help to bring this to reality!\u00a0 With the proper amount of funding and moving forward with all previous work, time and money spent, I believe we can make such a device that can be affordable and practical to use everyday and SAVE LIVES!\u00a0 ( Death toll from the CoVID-19 already at 3,043 with 88,948 infected globally )     All studies are scientifically proven and so a personal device could be as small as a can of soda, using a USB charge port/battery to provide power. This is a reboot of many years of work and concern for the health of everyone that are effected every year by the flu and then the OUTBREAKS of unknown killer viruses that come from around the world. To build such a device is the humane and practical idea that could be disseminated to everyone who is susceptible with low immunity to all airborne viruses know today. (AIDS, elderly, cancer treatment, etc.)\u00a0\u00a0 I will be needing to find a smart team of design engineers (already have some concept ideas), manufacturing, developers, etc...    We need to start now, as the re-design (small device), prototype and manufacture process takes time and we need to get this personal safety device distributed to many people to STOP the spread of the virus and save lives!    Watch a dramatization of a virus being destroyed within the cartridge.      UVC destroys the viruses ability to propagate, it makes it sterilized.

As the spread of the deadly virus is still accelerating,\u00a0 more and more people are sent to despair due to the lack of access to medical help and their income sources.  \u00a0Chinese Trading and Investment Association , a registered nonprofit organization in the US, together with  Fudan Alumni (Chicago) Association ,  PKU (Chicago) Alumni Association ,  Chicago-ND ,  University of Chicago Booth School Alumni Association, Chinese American Association of Central Illinois, \u00a0is organizing this relief fund to help those people.

    "description": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Hi ,   \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n As you have known that corona virus widely spread out in China. And now, in Vietnam, there are cases increasingly and there having people get isolated even though we could not know how many as an exact number have died. From the countryside and uplifted areas of Vietnam, there are a lot of the poor. It is actually hard for them to survive if there aren\u2019t enough medical supplies and food. I am afraid in the coming days the Corona virus could able to spread out. As you know that my hometown-Vietnam is one of low growth countries, they don\u2019t have foods, medicine or even medical supply or even the hospital to secure the patient as Chinese people did. I don\u2019t want to see my home country Vietnam will become the second center of disease outbreak in the upcoming days. It is sympathy for the death in China and it is heartbroken since I know that one day it can able happen in Vietnam in near future because my country is having lack of foods medical supplies, and many of poor in uplifted areas and countryside are facing dealing with many difficulties. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  I watched videos everyday, I felt heartbroken to know in China the number of death increases everyday and can not count how many the number of people and places getting infections. I think that it would happen in Vietnam soon. I think I may do something other than just seat and watch videos. I want to do something to help other people in my hometown. I want to give hand to help others prevent this disease because I knew that they need our help. I think I have to do something other than just scowl in silence.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  My family is Catholic, my mom and my dad told me pray for the disease everyday. Yes, of course, I do pray everyday, I pray for the health of the world. I knew praying is necessary but still not enough to prevent the epidemic from spreading and harsh, I need to do something more realistic. That is a reason why I make this fundraiser because I hope I could able to receive some fund in order to buy more foods, medicine and medical supplies for the poor people in Vietnam.   Everybody have a dream, yes, they are now dream of being cured in times of danger. China is now a center of the disease. Vietnam is close to China if Vietnam is going to be an outbreak, it will break out in the coming days. Wealthy China still has the ability to cope, and Vietnam is a slow-growing poor country, poor people will be miserable. For those people who live in the countryside, the uplifted the highland areas are the people who need to help because their life is still hungry, torn clothes, let alone plague. They do not have the means to cope with the Corona disease. They need food, medicine and medical supplies to prepare for the coming disease. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Yes, counting people in sickness in one country is tough. We can do math here, it is hard to imagine if we can count how many country have their residents involved to the sickness and from there, it spread out to other relatives and community, number would be increased. Please do math again, we can multiply them together, get any number you want. Next, for rich country they can able to secure them or have enough food and medical supply to help the patient, but with poor country, there will be more people die in silence and the virus could be able to widespread. I feel sad if I keep continue to multiple them again and again...I have thought that is there are any way to stop the spreading. I just cannot imagine which is the better way to help them, but I knew that they need our help sooner. I think the more we try stoping spread out of Corona disease sooner is the more better for everybody surround and better for also other country near by.     \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Last but not least, I hope I can have your helping hand. I will use all this donation for the charity - getting more foodstuffs and medical supply for the poor in Vietnam. I am appreciated for any help that you could make. Please save the poor Vietnam on preventing the Corona Virus. We need your help in the near future. Please\u00a0save  Vietnam on preventing the Corona diseases. God bless you, Amen!\n\n\n https://www.change.org/p/united-nations-call-for-the-resignation-of-tedros-adhanom-ghebreyesus-who-director-general?recruiter=1043450372 utm_source=share_petition utm_medium=sms utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_initial recruited_by_id=f47da0b0-51d1-11ea-a544-938f2b557b3e \n\n\n\n\n!",

    "description": "Jaime and I have lived in Hong Kong for 15 years and the experiences this city provides, shapes us into the people we are today. Its given us the opportunity to build great personal and professional relationships.\u00a0 It is our home and the people of Hong Kong are our community.\u00a0  The coronavirus has spread to HK and the exact course it will take is unknown. Currently, the focus of many HK citizens is prevention and the ability to take care of themselves and their family. There has been a run on basic supplies, lack of supplies and retailers who take advantage by price gauging. Some call this survival instincts, hysteria and others think it's fueled my rumors. Either way, the reality is people gain peace of mind when they have reserves of necessities and others simply do not have the means to procure them.  My family and I were able to leave HK before the virus spread and receive daily requests to send supplies from the US back. Many of the requests come from work colleagues, other factory owners and my own China workers/team.  The main requests are:  Face Masks - basic surgical and N95\u00a0 Hand Sanitizer Antibacterial Wipes - for hands and home Lysol Disinfectant Spray\u00a0 Toilet Paper\u00a0  We purchased a lot of supplies ourselves but ask our friends and community to help in our ability to do more. We hope through fund raising we can purchase larger quantities and more frequently ship items back by Fedex (USPS suspended shipping to HK/China).  None of the items purchased through fund raising will be put to personal use. We will disseminate the products to the families of our factory workers , local cleaners, the elderly (drop off at local elderly homes and centers) and charities who help those with limited financial means.  We truly appreciate all the support, concern and love.",

If this page raises 100,000 dollars I will contact the CDC on and offer myself as a Guinea Pig. To be locked in a room with either confirmed cases with no symptoms, or confirmed cases that are too early to show symptoms. If it\u2019s proved that neither Asymptomatic nor incubating individuals are transmitting it. Then I will allow them to test the distance the virus travels in aerosols or how long droplets can live on a surface. My only real rule would be that the tests be done in a western country (preferably the United States) and atleast 20% of the staff speak English so I understand what\u2019s going on.",

    "description": "\n My hometown Wuhan is deeply affected by the coronavirus outbreak and my family members, as healthcare professionals, are working in Tongji hospital, one of the major hospitals in the province helping with the infected patients. As of now, the death toll from the coronavirus rose to roughly 1,360, and the total confirmed cases worldwide surpassed 60,000.\n \n\n Tongji hospital is currently in great need of medical supplies, including n95 masks, surgical masks, safety goggles, surgical gloves etc. All medical personnel will be starting to work full-time in the following weeks and all masks need to be changed every 4 hours to ensure their effectiveness. Therefore, with your donation of a small amount could prevent people from being endangered by the virus.\u00a0  As the supplies have run out in stores, we are fortunate to collaborate with Tzu Chi Medical Foundation located in Alhambra, CA to get the medical supplies and donate them directly to the Tongji hospital in Wuhan.  Again, your contribution is greatly greatly appreciated! Please email me at  linadu628@gmail.com \u00a0should you have any questions.",

    "description": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a growing global threat.  [Photo above shows the latest global picture of the spread of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) as of February 10, 2020 ]   Many hospitals in regions of China are experiencing a shortage of medical protective supplies, putting medical workers at risk and possibly contributing to the spread of the infection.  The students of the International Public Policy and Management (IPPAM) Program at the USC Price School of Public Policy seek to galvanize public support to assist medical workers in China, who are on the frontlines in caring for patients.\u00a0 Quick action now can have an impact on assisting hospitals and medical providers in China.  We have been in contact with the Shanghai and Jiangsu Center of Disease Control, who have provided a list of medical supplies (surgical masks, N95 and protective suits) needed by hospitals in their jurisdictions and who have agreed to distribute supplies sent to them.\u00a0 We have also contacted manufacturers of supplies such as surgical masks in a number of countries who can ramp up production to increase the shipment of supplies to China.\u00a0 We have contacted international and local logistics companies to help in the transport of the supplies.  We are launching a fundraising campaign on Go Fund Me.\u00a0 The funds will be used to facilitate the purchase and transport of medical protective supplies that will be distributed to hospitals in China.\u00a0  As global citizens, we recognize that epidemics, natural disasters and strife can strike anywhere. We believe that those outside of the crisis zone should come to the aid of those in need. We are part of an educational program that has many students and alumni from China. This is a time when we can let them know that we stand with them as they work to contain the epidemic. We hope that you will join us. Time is of the essence.\u00a0 Please give what you can.  You will be able to track our efforts on the Go Fund Me page and on our social media sites.   We are in discussion with an NGO to jointly launch this campaign in order to have tax dedectible for every donor, which will take some time. As soon as we add this NGO in, we will let everyone know this good new.",

In the meantime, one can only imagine how difficult it must be for some dancers in the Far East to dance, find work, and even continue to survive in the current conditions. \u00a0Some of them have lost all their work and income completely. \u00a0Studios are being closed down. \u00a0They are struggling to not only earn enough money but to even just stay healthy as some are even fighting the deadly virus. \u00a0These people, these dancers, are our colleagues, students, and friends. \u00a0They are suffering and struggling to survive!  We, at the WDC Competitors Commission as well as the WDC and WDCAL, would like to ensure that we do everything we can to help our fellow colleagues and dancers in the Far East. \u00a0We would have set up this GoFundMe page to help our fellow dancers in the Far East and we want to encourage our friends, patrons, vendors, suppliers, and colleagues from around the world to pull together and help one another in overcoming this crisis. \u00a0We are asking everyone to extend your hand and support for our fellow dancers. \u00a0Your donation will be a great help for the dancers that have been affected the most by this deadly virus in the epidemic city of Wuhan and other neighboring affected cities in the Hubei Province. \u00a0  Your donations will be greatly appreciated and all donations will go to the NDC of China, a member organization of the World Dance Council, for distribution to those dancers that need it the most. \u00a0Any donation will go a long way for those greatly affected by this terrible virus!

    "description": "The current NCP (Novel coronavirus pneumonia) epidemic in China has caused tens of thousands of infections. As of February 11th, there were 42,715 confirmed infections and 1,017 deaths, and number of confirmed and suspected cases has increased by more than 5,000 every day. Wuhan is the largest outbreak area in China, however, the total geographic area affected by the virus encompasses approximately 70% of the county at present. And the number of infected people in various provinces across China is increasing.   \u00a0  Since the outbreak of pneumonia (which is caused by the coronavirus), Shenyang City, as the center of Liaoning Province, is implementing a centralized treatment program for patients with corona virus-related pneumonia in Shenyang and 7 surrounding cities. And the Chinese government also remains at the forefront of efforts to contain the current epidemic prevention, as well. Together with the medical community (hospitals and physicians) and Chinese citizens, the government of China is aggressively working to curb the spread of the virus and protect everyone\u2019s health. Everyone should continue to work together to help eradicate this public health threat. \u00a0  The medical community is also taking steps to maximize the supply of available protective clothing and sanitary masks; however, demand for these items currently exceeds available supply. In order to improve prevention and control of the epidemic, several key hospitals in Liaoning Province have put forth proposals to all sectors of the society, asking for domestic and international assistance by donating urgently needed protective garments and masks to Liaoning Province.   As a Liaoning native living here in the United States, Mr. Ming Li has been working to help provide protective medical garments and masks for the people in his hometown, as well as for medical staff members. Thanks to everyone\u2019s assistance, the first batch of N95 protective masks and medical protective clothing are already on their way to China.   Primary protective healthcare materials include:   \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 N95 mask (International Standard: ISO22609:2005, American Standard: NIOSH, N95/N99 + Fluid resistant, European Standard: EN14683-2005, Chinese Standard: GB19083-2010)  \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Protective Eyewear (elastic wear (compatible with myopia), wide field of vision, splash-proof function, without ventilations, such as: 3M 1623AF)  \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Protective Clothing (International Standard: ISO22609:2004, American Standard: ASTMF1671-A, SH 42 CFR84; ANSI/AAMI, EU Standard: EN14126, Chinese Standard: GB 19082) \u00a0 We continue to need donations to provide desperately needed medical supplies to all affected areas in China.\u00a0 All donations will strictly be used to purchase medical supplies and provide shipping costs for sending to key hospitals in Liaoning Province, such as:  \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Sixth People\u2019s Hospital of Shenyang (Liaoning Infectious Disease Hospital)  \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University  \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Shengjing Hospital Affiliated to China Medical University \u00a0 Please help us with your generous donations and we\u2018ll continue to do our best to provide the assistance needed to help everyone who has been affected by this event.

Wuhan, where the outbreak started, has 34289 people infected, and has been quarantined for 22 days.  Medical\u00a0supplies such as protective clothing are in shortage  and hospital workers are contacting the virus, especially as the gear needs to be changed.\u00a0 If you would like to find out more: [  https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/13/asia/coronavirus-health-care-workers-infected-intl-hnk/index.html  ]  What we think: Even in this overwhelming situation, we are still trying to contribute what we can as ordinary people. My friends and I have been wanting to do something, to protect the people that are fighting the virus in the hospital, and to protect individual from getting infected. For those who may not know, the Red Cross has been notoriously unreliable for getting supplies hospitals in the current crisis, and we want to act directly. [  https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/06/asia/red-cross-china-donations-intl-hnk/index.html ] \u00a0  What we are going to do: We are in contact with  a Chinese manufacturer of protective clothing , to purchase more supplies to send to  Tianyou Hospital in Wuhan .  Tianyou Hospital is a designated hospital for coronavirus. (We have contacted the hospital and confirmed that they are in shortage of the protective clothing we could provide).   While unfortunately we  have not been able to find protective suits that would meet the highest requirements for use by ICU staff ,  these suits will go to protect other hospital workers who is facing the risk . Those suits meet  the specification of GB19082-2009 (Chinese official standard), and manufacturer\u2019s qualification has been verified by the receiving hospital.\u00a0 My friends and I will be donating 200 suits, and I would like to invite anyone else who would like to contribute to donating more units.  As\u00a0 we hope to contribute as soon as possible,  we aim to place the order with however much we can raise by the end of today .\u00a0\n \n\n current and future situation will be updated here:   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11Jkkc0ksYspk4iqxgPKpdrMjdQt-qKCW01ePJwkoYXo",

Which is why we have raised our goal from $2000 to $3500. They are being flown to Omaha, Nebraska where they will be quarantined for 14 days to ensure they are negative for the coronavirus.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n They have to pay for this with no financial help from the government which is why we are seeking help for them. \u00a0After being quarantined they will have to travel to California to be reunited with their family. This money will help them buy food, diapers, water, and necessities after their quarantine is over and they can return to their jobs.\n\n\n \nWhen they finally arrive I will give them the donations and they will be very happy for all the support \n\n\n\n Any donations would mean the world to us.

Today, as of 08.20 Jakarta time, there were 44,911 cases infected with Corona Virus, 1,114 of whom died, and 4,699 others were declared recovered. It was based on data compiled by Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE).  If calculated from the previous day, today has added 1,770 new cases that have been infected, claimed 96 lives, and 359 people have been cured.  Based on data released by WHO yesterday: In Singapore, there were 47 cases of someone infected with the Corona Virus, 23 of whom were traced to have a travel history from China. Whereas in the Philippines there were 3 cases and 1 person died because of this virus. Then in other nearby countries of Indonesia: 15 cases in Malaysia, 15 Australia, 33 Thailand, and 15 Vietnam.  World Health Organization (WHO) Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus confirmed that 42,708 confirmed patients were located in China. A total of 1,017 people in the country have died due to Corona Virus. The highest mortality rate is in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.  \"Outside of China, there are 393 cases in 24 countries, and 1 death,\" Ghebreyesus said yesterday.  Ghebreyesus asserted, since yesterday, the number of deaths has exceeded a thousand. He warned of the global threat of death from the Corona Virus, potentially worse than terrorism.  \"Viruses can have stronger consequences than any terrorist act,\" he said.  The Indonesian government, until now still claims that no Corona Virus has been detected in the country. Minister of Health Terawan Agus Putranto asserted, until now the filtering pattern carried out has been in accordance with international standards.  \"Everything has been checked.

    "description": "Hello,\u00a0 My son, Emmanuel, and I were evacuated from Wuhan on the 4th of February by the US embassy. My wife was not able to leave on the evac flight, because she is a Chinese citizen who only has a tourist visa and not a green card.\u00a0 In addition, her father is infected with the corona virus and she wanted to stay to take care of him. Since we arrived in the US, his condition have seriously declined.\u00a0 His oxygen level plummeted to 70, from 99 just two days before.\u00a0 \u00a0We are waiting for CT scans, but we were told he is dying.\u00a0 The hospitals won't admit him to the intensive care unit because there are no beds available.\u00a0\u00a0  Three months ago, we lost her mother to a massive stroke.\u00a0 This is just too much for us, especially my wife and son, who constantly asks where \"Nai Nai\" is (grandma). If the worst happens, my wife would not be able to hold a traditional funeral, as bodies are immediately sequestered and cremated, without the family being around.\u00a0\u00a0  We hope that with this money, we can help pay our bills in America for Emmanuel and I.\u00a0 The quarantine is free, but flights out of California to family in the East coast is very expensive, as was the 3,600 dollar trip from China.\u00a0 We also hope to be able to get my wife here with us.\u00a0 I can't imagine her going through another funeral, all alone this time. We hope to use the funds to pay for our expenses here in American, but also to send much needed supplies to my wife in China.\u00a0 Roads and public transport in the city are closed and medication is extremely hard to get a hold of.\u00a0 Even face masks are being sold one per person. Now that my baby is safe, my concern is making things easier for my wife, as much as possible.\u00a0 We miss her dearly and I know what she is going through with her father, without her family to support her, is destroying here.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know what to do, but I want to try anything I can. With your donations, I hope to be able to pay for these unexpected expenses. These include repaying the US government 3,600 dollars for the flight to New York, additional flights to my families home in Philadelphia, clothing for my three year old (we were told to pack light and the weather where we live is much warmer than in Philadelphia ). In addition, since Chinese banks only issue one bank card per account, we decided my wife should keep it so she can pay for medical bills there, but food, pay rent, etc. As such, paying for necessities here in America will be a challenge. Also, in the unfortunate occurrence that my son and I need medical care (I take prescription medicine) my insurance is not valid in the United States. Finally, we hope to be able to fly my wife to America, to reunite our family Thank you for taking the time to read this and thank you for any donation you may give.",

    "description": "Hello, I am currently an elementary teacher in Hanoi, Vietnam. It\u2019s a very rewarding and exciting job- that is when the COVID-19 aka Corona Virus doesn\u2019t force the schools to close. The information about the closures has come to the public schools within a days\u2019 notice one week at a time. It has been proposed by Ho Chi Minh city that schools could stay closed until April. I am on forced unpaid leave and it is likely going to last 2 months.\u00a0 During this time of uncertainty we don\u2019t know until when as the information comes out at the last minute.  \u00a0I really miss teaching my students and guiding them to enjoy learning English through games, activities, and prizes.     Since I can\u2019t teach my students due to the forced shut down, I would like to do something more useful and meaningful with my time. Instead of hiding from the Virus in my little apartment in Hanoi for another month, I\u2019ve decided to try and make the most of my time to go back to volunteering for a bit. So, I am asking if anyone would like to help me make it to Nepal/ or the Philippines, wherever the need is the greatest and cheapest to volunteer. \u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I am 100% committed to using my skills and time volunteering during this break so I will make whatever I get work! So, every dollar, penny, dong, like, share, or positive message you can share, whatever you can throw my way counts! I have already been approved to go volunteer so now I just need to get there!!! Thank you for reading/sharing  3  Some of the cost include the transportation, visa, food/accommodations, and some materials needed. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask!",

Her vehicle overturned and is now a complete loss. She was in the vehicle with her youngest son Jovanni Miraculously, my nephew was not physically hurt as of now but we worry about psychological well being, but Jackie was not quite so lucky. She suffered a dislocated shoulder, broken collarbone, shattered elbow, broken ribs and extensive damage to her hand and fingers. She has undergone several hours of surgery to save her fingers, which at one point they thought they would have to amputate. She will undergo more surgeries this coming week and will also require physical therapy. She currently remains in the ICU unit. Her husband is the only one employed at this time but Jackie would like him by her side, which is understandable. I created this Go Fund Me account to raise funds to help with her family with medical bills, expenses and child care. We are unsure at this time when she will return to work. Please help us by donating or sharing this post with friends and family members. We thank you very much for your support during these hard times.",

Let's stop this extremely sad situation while we can!  --   As more and more  reports\u00b9   begin\u00b2 \u00a0 to  emerge\u00b3 \u00a0 (as well as devastating  videos\u2074 \u00a0) of the massive amount of animal cruelty happening in China as a result of the panic surrounding the Coronavirus outbreak. With the amount of attention given to the human victims and preventative efforts, it's a crucial time to give attention to the situation affecting animals as well.  Warning: Graphic Image Below    In addition to the (currently) 70,000+ person confirmed cases, reports of thousands of pets being affected as a result of the scare. People are leaving homes quickly and abandoning their pets resulting in starvation and accidental deaths. Even more shocking are the reports (and graphic videos) of the slaying of stray animals in a disgustingly misguided effort to limit the spread of the virus.  Warning: Graphic Image Below    Since the vast majority of the current efforts are focused on the human victims and preventative efforts, we've organized a plan with local volunteers already in the Hubei province and surrounding areas. Money from this fundraiser will be used for food, shelter, and caretaking for animals in the most affected areas.      We only share these devastating photos to shine light on the current reality of the situation which isn't being given much attention.",

    "description": "Change a Life Today. Donate now. \u00a0 Dear friends,  COVID-19 doesn\u2019t discriminate against our race, age, gender or nationality. Helping people in Wuhan, the epicentre of the deadly coronavirus outbreak to contain the spread of the epidemic is helping ourselves.  A plague at such scale would be disastrous for any city in the world. All hospitals in Wuhan reported low stock on medical supplies as they are experiencing an unprecedented patients intake each day.  Frontline healthcare professionals and first responders, amidst the lunar New Year holiday, are working 24/7 to treat the sick, save lives and bring this outbreak under control. They skip meals and washroom breaks in order to save on disposal of protective coveralls.  The emerging, rapidly evolving situation touches the hearts of billions of people worldwide.  This coronavirus relief campaign aims to provide desperately needed medical supplies such as masks, hazmat suits and gloves to the frontline healthcare workers and hospitals in Wuhan, to help prevent the spread of the virus.  To date, 40,000 pairs of gloves and 10,000 isolation gowns are en route to Wuhan. Protective goggles, impact-proof masks and hazmat suits worth $25,000 are being purchased.  We are proud to announce our partnership with the Crackup Ottawa Comedy Festival! A portion of their ticket sales for DASHAN AND FRIENDS on Thursday, March 26 and CRACKUP OTTAWA FESTIVAL FINALE on Friday, March 27 will be donated to our coronavirus relief. Details of the events can be found here -   http://www.crackup.ca/events  .  Crackup Ottawa will also be promoting our \u201cGoFundMe\u201d campaign with the goal of raising an additional $100,000 in private and corporate donations from the Ottawa and Canadian comedy community.",

    "description": "Hello everyone, My name is Kirsten and i am a Chinese Australian living in Melbourne. As a Chinese, I feel the need to help my people in need.\u00a0 As you all know, the Corona Virus disease has claimed the lives of over 1000 people and over 70,000 people are affected with the numbers going up every single day.  Hospitals in Wuhan are running out of medical supplies and the money donated will go towards hardworking medical staff who are risking their lives to help fight the virus and victims affected by the deadly virus. It will also go towards buying protective supplies from around the world and send it to hospitals in Wuhan and all the small cities in the Hubei province. for patients and medical workers to ensure they are safe and protected from the virus.\u00a0  The money donated will go into buying N95 masks from different places around the world, these masks will go to medical workers and people in Wuhan and the other small cities in the Hubei province, those people have less access to medical supplies but the virus there is just as deadly.\u00a0  The masks will also go to regular citizens in Wuhan and Hubei province who may not have enough money to buy masks as many sellers have raised the price of face masks when people need them most to ridiclously high prices.  You may not know this but Hospitals in Wuhan right now are a living hell, hospitals have run out of beds for patients and medical supplies like masks are running low. People are collapsing in hospital hallways and medical workers are working hours non stop to save lives. Doctors and nurses and other medical staff have been infected by the virus and are dying every single day.  Even a bit of your money can help those people in desperate need, although this might not affect your daily lives, people in Wuhan are in a living hell right now. As humans, we must stick together during tough times and together we can help fight this virus.\u00a0  If you cannot donate, please share this around and help spread awareness, thank you for your kindness and willingness to help. \u6b66\u6c49\u52a0\u6cb9!!   I will keep you guys updated :)\u00a0 \u00a0  Here are some links and videos of the situation in Wuhan right now   https://youtu.be/OSi9fCSZbgE      https://youtu.be/XAHOnZNRvZI  \u00a0   https://youtu.be/2Dpf7pli5Ag  \u00a0   https://youtu.be/m6S51KPWKCY",

    "description": "Chinese health officials reported on 02/13/2020 that there had been 1,491 deaths from the outbreak and 64,658 cases of the coronavirus in China. (cnn.com) Wuhan suffered a considerable loss, China and the world focused on Wuhan. Lots of resources are shipped to Wuhan. However, besides Wuhan, the other small cities in Hubei province also suffered the impacts from the coronavirus. The growing number of patients and questioning cases put significant pressure on the hospitals of the smaller cities. Comparing to Wuhan, these cities are in shortage of medical resources. They need help from us!  Xiangyang has 5.6 million population, has confirmed 441 coronavirus patients. Because there are not enough testing equipment and medical resources, a lot of suspected patients have to isolate themselves home. Now, we are working with Xiangyang Integration of Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital, which was appointed as the coronavirus patient treatment hospital on 01/25/2020. My friend Xinhui Gao and I (Zijing Zhu) contacted a medical worker in the hospital. They are still in the condition of lacking the essential medical supplies such as masks, surgical goggles, and protective suits. We want to do what we can to help the situation, and your generous contribution will help the hospital to acquire the medical necessities. We hope that our donation will help beat the coronavirus!  Information about the account that we are donating to:    Here's a video of the current medical condition in China:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCpQXza2mFs",

    "title": "Help Henan Fight through Coronavirus",
    "description": "Dear all,  The Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is now rapidly spreading throughout China. As of February 10th 2020 , 40,265 persons were confirmed of being diagnosed with the 2019-nCoV, with 909 deaths so far. As time goes, the confirmed case dramatically emerged in Henan Province, as of February 10th (Henan local time) 1073 cases were confirmed with 6 deaths and 187 cures. In the fight against the pneumonia epidemic of the new coronavirus infection, the biggest challenge is the shortage of medical supplies/consumables which are the key to protect medical service providers, including thousands of doctors and nurses who are doing their best to resuscitate patients in critical conditions and save the lives of infected patients, some patients are their peer doctors/nurses who were unfortunately sickened by this disease. We witness that they were fighting relentlessly in dangerous situations to help cure Chinese patients and to control the spread of this contagious disease from infecting more people outside of China.   Henan University Alumni Association in the United States would like to unite our efforts to provide stronger help and charity support to the hospitals and patients in Henan Province, with the hope to save more lives and prevent doctors/nurses being affected by the virus with more needed resources.  We are here to sincerely call on for any support and contribution in any format, i.e. funds, medical supplies/consumables, medical resources and support, and so forth. Our overseas fundraising channel is now open and all-out efforts are being made to open overseas materials transportation and fundraising channels, we will ensure your support and funds are transferred to the people in need.  We appeal to all people with kindness and love. Please join us in making an impact and your help will be highly appreciated.   Plan on how to use funds: With the funds raised, we are going to purchase medical consumables in urgent needs as the following: Surgical mask, Medical N95 Mask, safety goggles, protective eyewear, protective cap, medical protective suit, etc.   We will purchase medical consumables in USA, then coordinate with major airlines to ship all materials/supplies to Henan Province in China. Charity funds and resources will be donated to the major hospitals in the cities of Xinyang, Nanyang, Zhumadian, Zhengzhou and many more in Henan Province which are more in urgent needs.   Updates and photos on how the charity funds are used and where your donation goes will be updated on this website. Our alumni will announce the fundraising amount in real time and ensure that all the funds received be used properly and at donors' wish to better prevent the epidemic from further spreading.\u00a0  With your help, we firmly believe that we will definitely succeed in this fight against 2019-CoronaVirus!

Help Reconstruction!\u00a0  The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is sill under way in China, especially in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province. Wuhan and at least 15 other cities (including Huanggang, Huangshi, Jingzhou, Yichang, ... ) have been quarantined as China attempts to halt the spread of the coronavirus. That's more than 50 million people on lockdown. Plenty of stress but shortage of everything else for these cities. There are not enough hospitals and not enough beds, not enough doctors and not enough nurses, not enough rubber gloves and not enough face masks. Millions of people are suffering from infections, panic attacks, and even death in these lockdown cities. Things are worst in many small cities.\u00a0  Lots of families are faced with the difficult task of recovery and reconstruction after disaster. Many of them lost their family members during outbreak. Many of them have serious after-effects of a disaster, especially for children and young people.\u00a0 Many of them are devastated by the coronavirus . They need help. They need our support.\u00a0  Let's help China defeat 2019-nCov.\u00a0 We will continue to help persons in affected areas of China (Wuhan and other seriously affected cities) to overcome this crisis and build back their life. We believe unity is strength; we beliveve faith will overcome panic attacks; and we believe we can win the battle against the virus.\u00a0  The donations will be used to purchase medical supplies for medical staff and people who are fighting against the 2019-nCoV in Wuhan and other cities. The donations will also be used for helping hard-hit families during the outbreak and after disaster.\u00a0  This donation campaign is launched by our Chinese community from Greater Memphis United Chinese Association, University of Memphis, University of Tenenssee, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis Chinese Evangelical Church, the Confucius Insititute at the University of Memphis and other organizations at Memphis.

    "description": "We are getting married! As we learn how to plan a wedding, we found out that we should have a registry for our guests. While we could easily put together a long list, we also noticed that none of the items on the wish list matter to us that much. The items that we would put on a registry will make our life marginally better such as a nice vacuum or a new watch, however, we believe that your money could be used in more meaningful ways - such as saving lives.\u00a0   Since the outbreak of the coronavirus in Wuhan, more than 70,000 people have been infected and more than 1,500 have died globally, making it a more damaging epidemic than SARS.\u00a0   In one local hospital in Wuhan, nearly 3 in 10 patients are health professionals, according to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association ( link ).\u00a0   Among the health professionals who are fighting against the virus, many have to   work for extended hours and isolate themselves from their families for weeks. All of these are happening whilst there's a severe shortage of basic medical supplies such as surgical masks and protective clothing. Many doctors have to reuse protective goggles that are meant for single-use and use tapes to DIY their protective clothing ( NYTimes \u00a0).    Figure: A vigil in Hong Kong for Dr. Li Wenliang who died from the coronavirus. He was among the first 8 doctors to alarm the public about the outbreak but he was initially accused by the local authority as a rumormonger. (Anthony Wallace/AFP via Getty Images)  To honor their sacrifice, we have decided to start this fundraising initiative. All funds gathered by March 15 will be donated to Wuhan University Alumni Association to support the local hospitals and medical professionals who are risking their lives combatting the outbreak. This particular organization is selected because of its outstanding performance during this epidemic. It has raised over $700,000 with its own fundraising initiative ( link \u00a0) and is providing constant updates on the spending of the money. Although it will definitely take more than one wedding fundraising initiative to conquer this outbreak, we would like to be a small part of the solution and we invite you to join us. We really appreciate your support.  Note: If by the time we finish the fundraising, the virus has been eliminated or mitigated to a level that there is no need to donate to local hospitals or if no reliable logistic channels can be used to deliver the supplies, we plan to use this money to help with local students who are affected by this virus outbreak.",

College is soon going to become a distant past for me as a current 4th year.   This year I want it to be different.   I already have a group of 10 solid dudes ready to party it up on the warm beaches of Punta Cana. Everything is already planned out. However, due to the recent outbreak of Coronavirus, my extremely cautious Chinese parents will not condone nor sponsor my travel plans. They rightly fear for my safety. However, I believe it is unreasonable to think that traveling to a non affected country will bring me at risk of contracting the virus.\u00a0  As a broke college student, I ask you, people of the world, to help me realize my college dreams before I graduate. Lets turn that fear of Coronavirus into a cold golden drink in my hand.  Thank you, Lex",

    "description": "My name is Ramone, a medical student, and an aspiring Pediatric Oncologist currently studying in China. I am a member of a core research team that focuses on Osteosarcomas, Multiple Myeloma, and the NK Cell-Based Immunotherapy, together with the Tumor Immunology of various other cancers. I\u00a0have co-authored and published several scientific research papers in a number of peer-reviewed journals. \n\nTowards the ending of January just before the Chinese New Year, I left China for what should have been a short travel to Malaysia. Within two days, I learned that there was an outbreak of a novel coronavirus in the Wuhan province. The worst was yet to come as three days later, the now named 2019-nCOV had virtually spread to all provinces in China and resulted in several deaths. \n\nAt this point, my program coordinator had made contact and informed me that based on the worsening situation of the now viral epidemic, I could not return to China and that I should extend my travel for a few more days until given notice to return. \n\nAbout a week later I again attempted to return but was informed that there were travel restrictions and a partial shutdown implemented by several provincial governments in addition to a number of airline cancellations and that I was not allowed to return under any circumstances until notified to do so by the University. Failure to abide by the preventative measures implemented by the educational department and the government to slow the spread of the viral outbreak would result in serious disciplinary action being taken.\n\nSince then, I have been stuck alone in a foreign country waiting and hoping each day that the situation will somehow get better, and I would be allowed to return to China as I was unable to travel elsewhere due to travel bans imposed by a number of countries. Already having spent several weeks here with still no clear sign as to when I will be able to return, I again queried and was notified that courses would be conducted online for the period, and I should return home until notice is given for the resumption of regular classes/rotations. Thereafter, depending on the progress of the situation, I can apply in advance to return, providing that the outbreak is under control.\n\nPlease, if able to donate to help me stay afloat until I can return home as well as help with travel expenses I would be grateful. I have depleted all my resources and will try traveling to Jamaica soon. \nThanks in advance. I appreciate your kind assistance.\nIf you wish to see some of my published research articles, you may visit  https://www.mendeley.com/profiles/ramone-a-williamson/",

    "description": "\n    Please consider donating ASAP as this is an urgent issue!  WHO declares the 2019-nCoV a GLOBAL EMERGENCY \n \n\n  Hi, we are Richard Z. and Katherine H. from Mountain View High School in Mountain View, CA. We are just students who want to help in an ongoing world issue.  As you may know already, the China coronavirus, known medically as the 2019-nCoV is currently spreading rapidly in China, and hospitals in Wuhan, the epicenter of this virus, are flooded with patients while not having enough medical supplies. The image is a letter from  The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University , asking for help from the public to donate  N95 respiratory masks, surgical masks, as well as hazardous material suits , with a certified government seal. The president of the Chinese Medical Association who works at  the Guangzhou Medical University , Zhong Nanshan, played a big role in controlling the outbreak of the 2003 SARS virus. He is also a leading scientist and researcher in this 2019-nCoV virus.  Currently the supply for these medical equipments in China are depleting quickly, as thousands of people a day rush to hospitals just for basic flu-like symptoms. The government has also sent medical professionals from this hospital by military plane to Wuhan to help stop the surprisingly contagious pandemic. Hospitals are filled with chaos, with not much to do and filled with patients to infect others, some which may have no problem with them at all. Sadly, the virus appeared during the Lunar New Year season, which means that people in the city return to their rural homes. Wuhan, a city of 12 million people, may have had much more infected people than the numbers posted by the Chinese government, and is most likely more widespread, as 5 million people left the epicenter of the outbreak just before they locked down.  We will  use your donations to purchase medical supplies and ship them to this hospital (The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University) , which will either ship them to hospitals in Wuhan, or use them as infection numbers increase. Richard's mother, Dr. Qiu, works at this hospital, and  the location is a certified donation point by the Chinese government . Anything is helpful. Please help us battle this virus together before it spreads to the places around you. Thank you.  For questions about this fundraiser, please feel free to contact us using the \"contact\" button down below. We will give you a response as soon as we can.",

    "title": "Georgetown Students Help Fight Coronavirus",
    "description": "Visit our website:  www.georgetowncovid19.com \u00a0  We are a group of students from Georgetown University, and we are fundraising for medical supplies and devices to support hospitals in China to assist patients infected by or under the threat of COVID-19.   Why are we doing this fundraiser?  The SARS-CoV-2 virus (previously known as the 2019 novel coronavirus) has permeated our news and conversations for the past month. Yet, no news can rightfully communicate the fear, confusion, and helplessness of those that are infected or quarantined, nor the courage and sacrifice of the doctors, nurses, and volunteers battling on the frontline. Many Georgetown students have families in China and Wuhan. They are worried and have contributed a lot of time and effort to help their families and others in China.   As students of Georgetown University, we are guided by the Jesuit tradition of Cura Personalis -- \u201ccare for the whole person\u201d, and believe that it is part of our responsibility to help the members of the global community who are most severely affected by the COVID-19 global pandemic.   Therefore, we are holding this fundraiser to achieve two goals: 1. To provide funds that alleviate the immediate medical needs of Chinese hospitals on the frontline of fighting the coronavirus.  2. To empower members of the Georgetown community in making an impact on the fight against this global pandemic.    Where are the proceeds going?  The proceeds of this fundraiser will go to  Beijing Chunmiao Charity Foundation . We chose them because of their demonstrated quickness to respond, their proven ability to obtain medical supplies and devices to hospitals in need, and their emphasis on operational transparency.  Links to learn more:  Description of Chunmiao in English   About Chunmiao's coronavirus project  (can be translated using Chrome browser)  Chunmiao is a Chinese non-profit founded in 2010 specializing in public welfare projects in caring for congenitally-ill children, healthcare, education, elderly-nursing, and poverty alleviation.  On January 27, 2020, Chunmiao formed a Coronavirus workgroup that was able to raise roughly 40M RMB (roughly 6M USD), more than 25M RMB of which is already spent to provide medical supplies and devices to hospitals in Wuhan and surrounding areas.  Chunmiao will decide the specific usage of our proceeds as they see fit (e.g. masks vs. ECMO machines) to the circumstances of the hospitals they support.    Fundraiser disclosure  Given that Chunmiao is non-profit registered in China only (meaning it cannot register itself on GoFundMe), we will transfer the proceeds to a personal account first before wiring them to Chunmiao's account in China.  Stanley He \u00a0, a current MBA student at Georgetown and the liaison between Chunmiao and us, will receive the proceeds and then wire them out.  We will be disclosing all financial transactions and records related to this fundraiser and obtain a receipt from Chunmiao. Chunmiao will also provide us a report on the usage of our donation to us. We are in the process of setting up a website to disclose this information.\u00a0   Members and friends of the Georgetown community, we hope to get your support to come together and help fight this global pandemic by supporting the people who are fighting the coronavirus and saving lives on the frontline.",

    "description": "    Virus has no borders   We have an urgent request for our concerned members of AMPSAA.\u00a0 We are looking for donations so that we can purchase and send over medical supplies to Wuhan and nearby cities in Hubei province, China.\u00a0 As you all may have heard in the news, the Coronavirus situation in Wuhan, China is critical. Worldwide over 1400 cases have been reported since the virus was first diagnosed in Wuhan on January 15, less than 10 days ago.\u00a0 These numbers are likely low, as individuals who have sent texts and emails from the region have reported that in some cases, because there are so many people going to the hospitals and there is not enough staff, people are just being sent home. Hospitals are over flowing in cases,\u00a0 running low or have no supplies of to offer supportive care and are lacking protective gear to protective their medical staff and contain and isolate infected cases.\u00a0  As of today, Wuhan and many other cities within the province have been quarantined. \u00a0 At least 17 cities within the province have been locked down. Individuals are not allowed to leave the cities, by plane, train, or any other means.\u00a0 Hospitals are overwhelmed and the Chinese government is building two emergency hospitals within the city. All public transportation within the city has been shutdown.\u00a0 Starting Sunday, use of private vehicles within the city will be banned.  Wuhan\u2019s need for medical assistance is severe.\u00a0 As the epicenter, with over 11 million people, the lack of adequate medical protection means that even those healthy individuals and the medical staff who are there to care for them are at great risk.\u00a0 It may seem that this is a \u201cChina problem, not a U.S. problem,\u201d but if the Coronavirus outbreak is not addressed now, by the time it reaches the same level of urgency in the U.S., it will have already reached emergency levels around the globe.\u00a0 We need to help China address the Coronavirus.  We are looking to send the following medical supplies, namely, surgical masks (N95 mask, YY 0469-2010), goggles to cover the entire face, disposable medical gloves, medical caps, shockproof eye masks, protective clothing (3M 4565), medical protective masks (GB 19083-2010).\u00a0 If you can donate these supplies, or donate money for us to purchase them, or have connections for AMPSAA to appeal directly, such help will be greatly appreciated. Please forward this to whomever you think can help. Thank you!",

    "description": "I was born in a country with an outdated educational system, a childhood of many incidents, and was a victim of crime. One day I decided that I only lived once, i had to live my own life, so i escaped. No one who knows me for the past 6 years knows my past, knows what I have suffered and overcome, alone. I have just started my own life for 6 years, from absolutely nothing. It took 6 years for me to build a life of my own.  Since i was a child, my dream is to become an artist. After 6 years of hard work to build a minimum life of a human being, I borrow money to study art and planned to use my monthly salary to pay off the loan. Its the bank that the company paying salary for employees through. The loan was deducted directly from my monthly salary.  Unfortunately, the COVID-19 epidemic occurred in December 2019, and the tourism industry in my country (an Indochina country, not China) is badly damaged, while I am working in a small travel company. The company has bankrupted and i lost my main job, which i supporsed to use to pay my loan tuition.   The bank asked me to pay the entire loan immediately, the deadline is 3 months later. I asked the school for a refund of the tuition fee and gave up my studies, but because I had already gone through half of the program, only half of the tuition was refunded. If I couldn't repay the loan, they would sue me and I would definitely go to jail. This will end my life, because the people who had committed crimes against me and I ran away from them, are the people in the police industry.  I have been doing a couple side jobs to pay monthly rent and expenses (I have worked ~14 hours per day all these years). Because the epidemic is still developing, my country's economy has plummeted, it's hard to find a new full-time job right now (Im still trying). Sometimes I think life is so unfair to me, but I know I'm still one of the luckiest people in the world when I'm still able to breathe everyday.  I knew that the epidemic would not end soon and the economy in my country would not recover soon, I tried to manage everything before finding the last way to seek support here. I am alone, without friend or relatives, without any support other than myself. I'm always proud of myself being my own superhero. But sometimes, specifically right now, the hero is already exhausted.  It is difficult for me to disclose all my personal information, because as I said above, my identity now is completely different from I was six years ago, and in a communist country, the publication of what I've been through can ruin my life. If you are interested, I will tell my story to you personally, please message me privately.   I know you will find it hard to believe my story, so please consider I'm begging you for a job, I know drawing and graphic design, please let me work for you, so you dont have to wonder if your kindness is being used. I would be happy to express my appreciation for your support by drawing you a portrait of yourself, or doing some graphic design like a banners or poster, anything you request - this is my firm commitment.  P/s : When I had money I used to donate monthly to a non-profit organization for the homeless and the blind, as a way of thanking life for giving me a second chance to live. When I posted this fundraiser, gofundme gave me a number of tasks to share with relatives, friends, social networking sites ... I suddenly felt hilarious for my destiny. I have no close ones in real life, and no friend on internet (I don't use any social networks - due to my special circumstances). If you come across my post, please do me a favour by sharing it on social media, because I don't have a chance to do that, and maybe very quickly this fundraiser will be forgotten. I still expect a miracle to happen here, even though I know the chances of it happening are very low...",

    "description": "Rome, 19/02/2020  Friends,   My name is Sophia Lilin Wu. I am a lay Chinese student of Theology, in the second year of the first cycle in Pontifical Gregorian University. As you all know, since the beginning of this new year 2020, China, especially Wuhan has suffered from the coronavirus. And because of this strong influence, this virus soon spread beyond Wuhan to other parts of China and around the world.  Seeing such suffering happening every day, my heart is broken. In order to help the Chinese people fight the coronavirus, especially to help my family who are living in Shandong province, I bought nearly 700 masks and sent them to China both to Shandong and to Beijing. A friend of mine in Beijing told me that even the doctors and nurses in the Hospital cannot find masks now, to say nothing of other people. Therefore, I tried my best to help them. As you see, without a mask, you cannot move one step regarding the high risks. Scientists found that the coronavirus even can influence people by air just in two seconds.   They urgently need to have enough masks in order to have at least the basic protection. I am the only one child in my family. From my childhood until now, both my father and mother tried their best to give me everything I need, to educate me in the best school, to encourage me to graduate from the best University in China (Peking University) as a Doctor of Philosophy, to support me to study Catholic theology in Rome even though they themselves are not Christians. However, the real and deep love is that whatever the decision I made they supported me. Love should repay love. So, I decide to give them the best medical supplies. From Jan.25th, the Chinese New Year until now Feb.19th, 2020, almost each day, I am looking for masks or sending masks. Finally, until today, there are already seven hundred masks going to China. Nonetheless, the ordinary shipping cannot go to China nowadays regarding the high risks, only DHL could help me to ship masks to China. But the cheapest and the smallest box in DHL cost 58 euro. In order to guarantee that they have masks in China, I must send many times and only for shipping in this month, almost 500 euro was spent. And because of the high needs, the price of masks rises 2 to 3 times. For example, before one masks FFP2 cost 5 euro, now you need to pay 10 euro, and masks FFP3 before 7 euro, now you should pay from 15 to 20 euro. But it can only use 8 hours. Though some friends also help me with some contributions, one month later, my bankcard finally has no money left. I remember in the evening of Feb. 17th, the first day of the second semester, the pharmacy called me they found more masks of FFP2. However, from my bankcard I can only buy 29 masks, then there is no money on this card. This money is the fund for supporting my living and studying in Rome, my mom transferred to me in last September. She always thought if there is something in urgent need, for example, when I got sick need to buy medicine, or want to go home, I can buy tickets. But now all of them turned to be masks. Indeed, before if I have urgent need, I can ask for support from parents. However, now China is at a standstill. I even do not know whether or not my father still has salary. Then I decided that this time, it is not they support me but I who support them. So, friends, please help me to continue my life and study in Rome. Just left one and half year, I will finish my first cycle of theology in Gregorian University. I have a basic scholarship which can support me bed and food, therefore, I ask for your help for this small part, in these seven months (from now to September). I need some money to do scan and photocopy, to prepare documents for applying new scholarship and for the summer tickets to go and back between Rome and Cracow. I have a dream that when finishing all of these studies, to work and live in Poland, so during the summer, I already planned to return to Poland to learn Polish. The scholarship for learning Polish, however, does not include transportation.  The belief for the beauty of human hearts push me to write this letter. As the song which was singing in the Beijing Olympic 2008 expressed: you and me, heart to heart, we are family.  Thank you with my deep heart, and I believe God will repay for your kindness.",

Laikus k\u00ednai teol\u00f3gia hallgat\u00f3 vagyok, a P\u00e1pai Gergely Egyetemen az els\u0151 ciklus m\u00e1sodik \u00e9v\u00e9ben. Mint mindannyian tudj\u00e1tok, a 2020-as \u00e9v kezdete \u00f3ta K\u00edna, k\u00fcl\u00f6n\u00f6sen Wuhan szenvedett a koronav\u00edrus miatt. \u00c9s ennek az er\u0151teljes influenz\u00e1nak k\u00f6sz\u00f6nhet\u0151en a v\u00edrus hamarosan Wuhanon \u00e1t \u00e1tterjedt K\u00edna m\u00e1s r\u00e9szeire \u00e9s a vil\u00e1g minden t\u00e1jaira is.

Annak \u00e9rdek\u00e9ben, hogy seg\u00edtsek a k\u00ednai n\u00e9pnek a koronav\u00edrus elleni k\u00fczdelemben, k\u00fcl\u00f6n\u00f6s tekintettel a Shandong tartom\u00e1nyban \u00e9l\u0151 csal\u00e1domnak, k\u00f6zel 700 maszkot v\u00e1s\u00e1roltam \u00e9s K\u00edn\u00e1ba k\u00fcldtem (mind Shandongba, mind Pekingbe). Egy pekingi bar\u00e1tom azt mondta nekem, hogy m\u00e9g a k\u00f3rh\u00e1z orvosai \u00e9s \u00e1pol\u00f3i sem tal\u00e1lnak maszkokat, nem is besz\u00e9lve az egyszer\u0171 emberekr\u0151l. Ez\u00e9rt minden t\u0151lem telhet\u0151t megtettem hogy megpr\u00f3b\u00e1ljak seg\u00edteni nekik. Mint l\u00e1tj\u00e1tok, maszk n\u00e9lk\u00fcl nem lehet tenni egy l\u00e9p\u00e9st sem az utc\u00e1n a magas kock\u00e1zat miatt.

Sz\u00f3val \u00fagy d\u00f6nt\u00f6ttem, hogy a legjobb orvosi ell\u00e1t\u00e1st adom nekik. Janu\u00e1r 25-t\u0151l, a k\u00ednai \u00faj\u00e9vt\u0151l mostan\u00e1ig, 2020. febru\u00e1r 19-ig, szinte minden nap maszkot keresek vagy maszkot k\u00fcld\u00f6k. Ily m\u00f3don m\u00e1r siker\u00fclt h\u00e9tsz\u00e1z maszkot K\u00edn\u00e1ba k\u00fcldenem.

De a DHL legolcs\u00f3bb \u00e9s legkisebb doboza 58 eur\u00f3ba ker\u00fclt. Az\u00e9rt hogy legyen el\u00e9g maszk K\u00edn\u00e1ban, t\u00f6bb k\u00fcldem\u00e9nyt kellett k\u00fcldenem, \u00e9s csak ebben a h\u00f3napban a sz\u00e1ll\u00edt\u00e1sra k\u00f6zel 500 eur\u00f3t k\u00f6lt\u00f6ttem el. A nagy ig\u00e9nyek miatt a maszkok \u00e1ra is 2-3-szoros\u00e1ra emelkedett. P\u00e9ld\u00e1ul, kor\u00e1bban egy FFP2 maszk 5 eur\u00f3ba ker\u00fclt, most 10 eur\u00f3t kell fizetni \u00e9rte. Az FFP3 maszk\u00e9rt kor\u00e1bban 7 eur\u00f3t kellett fizetni, most 15-20 eur\u00f3ba ker\u00fcl. De ez csak 8 \u00f3r\u00e1n kereszt\u00fcl haszn\u00e1lhat\u00f3. B\u00e1r n\u00e9h\u00e1ny bar\u00e1tom is hozz\u00e1j\u00e1rult bizonyos kiad\u00e1saimhoz, egy h\u00f3nap eltelt\u00e9vel, a bankk\u00e1rty\u00e1mr\u00f3l v\u00e9g\u00fcl minden p\u00e9nz elfogyott. Eml\u00e9kszem, hogy febru\u00e1r 17-\u00e9n este, a m\u00e1sodik f\u00e9l\u00e9v els\u0151 napj\u00e1n a gy\u00f3gyszert\u00e1r felh\u00edvott, hogy tal\u00e1ltak t\u00f6bb maszkot az FFP2-b\u0151l. A bankk\u00e1rty\u00e1mon l\u00e9v\u0151 p\u00e9nzb\u0151l azonban csak 29 maszkot v\u00e1s\u00e1rolhatok. Ez a p\u00e9nz az alap a r\u00f3mai \u00e9letem \u00e9s tanul\u00e1som t\u00e1mogat\u00e1s\u00e1ra, \u00e9desany\u00e1m tavaly szeptemberben utalta \u00e1t nekem. Mindig azt gondolta, hogy ha lenne valami s\u00fcrg\u0151s sz\u00fcks\u00e9g, p\u00e9ld\u00e1ul ha gy\u00f3gyszert kellene v\u00e1s\u00e1rolnom, vagy haza kellene mennem, ebb\u0151l tudn\u00e9k magamnak jegyet venni. De most az eg\u00e9sz p\u00e9nzt maszkokra ford\u00edtottam. Val\u00f3ban, kor\u00e1bban s\u00fcrg\u0151s sz\u00fcks\u00e9g eset\u00e9n, t\u00e1mogat\u00e1st k\u00e9rhettem volna a sz\u00fcl\u0151kt\u0151l. Most azonban K\u00edna le van blokkolva. M\u00e9g azt sem tudom, hogy \u00e9desap\u00e1mnak van-e tov\u00e1bbra is fizet\u00e9se? Azt\u00e1n \u00fagy d\u00f6nt\u00f6ttem, hogy ez\u00fattal nem \u0151k t\u00e1mogatnak engem, hanem \u00e9n t\u00e1mogatom \u0151ket. Teh\u00e1t, bar\u00e1taim, k\u00e9rlek benneteket, seg\u00edtsetek nekem az \u00e9letem folytat\u00e1s\u00e1ban \u00e9s a r\u00f3mai tanulm\u00e1nyaimban! M\u00e1r csak f\u00e9l \u00e9v maradt hogy befejezzem az els\u0151 ciklust a Gregoriana egyetemen. Van egy alap \u00f6szt\u00f6nd\u00edjam, amely megadja nekem a meg\u00e9lhet\u00e9st. De az ezen t\u00falmen\u0151 kiad\u00e1saimhoz a seg\u00edts\u00e9geteket szeretn\u00e9m k\u00e9rni az elk\u00f6vetkez\u0151 h\u00e9t h\u00f3napban (mostant\u00f3l szeptemberig). Sz\u00fcks\u00e9gem van n\u00e9mi p\u00e9nzre a scannel\u00e9shez \u00e9s a f\u00e9nym\u00e1sol\u00e1shoz az egyetemen, tov\u00e1bb\u00e1 az \u00faj \u00f6szt\u00f6nd\u00edj ig\u00e9nybev\u00e9tel\u00e9hez sz\u00fcks\u00e9ges dokumentumok el\u0151k\u00e9sz\u00edt\u00e9s\u00e9hez, valamint a ny\u00e1ri utik\u00f6lts\u00e9gre R\u00f3ma \u00e9s Krakk\u00f3 k\u00f6z\u00f6tt.

    "description": " THE TIME TO ACT IS NOW! YOU HOLD THE KEY TO PUTTING THE BRAKES ON THE CORONAVIRUS EPIDEMIC The Coronavirus is an epidemic that currently defies containment! Health authorities have been struggling to contain its spread ever since its discovery. Yet, the virus has now been declared a \u2018Public Health Emergency of International Concern\u2019 by the World Health Organization.  \u00a075,775 cases have been confirmed as of 20 February 2019, affecting every Chinese province and more than two dozen additional countries. 11,795 of these cases are serious and 2,130 individuals have died. There are travel restrictions in place, and signs of economic instability loom on the horizon. While scientists work frantically to develop a vaccine, the numbers of those afflicted continue to rise. Handwashing and distributing n95 masks seem to be the only way to deter its spread. But it\u2019s not a perfect solution, and keeping up with the demand for masks is daunting. My name is (mark v). I have launched this campaign to raise funds to quickly produce over one million n95 masks to distribute to children and hospitals before the current supply runs out. I have a production goal of 200,000 masks daily and am confident that I can reach this goal with your help! I am currently seeking $250,000 to order a production machine and two containers of materials to initiate production before it\u2019s too late! \u00a0Reaching this goal will also entail building a factory capable of mass production. I have identified Vietnam as the most logical place to launch this project because of its proximity to China and its robust labor force. \u00a0My plan is to then quickly apply new technology, such as incorporating copper into the masks\u2019 construction and/or a sodium chloride salt coating to destroy the pathogens. These two improvements will make n95 masks 100% effective. As an entrepreneur, my visionary thinking and problem-solving skills have prepared me for success. I will personally fly to Vietnam to hire the right people and oversee the factory\u2019s operations 24/7. But the generosity of donors is the real key to making my project a reality. Your donation will ensure that children and hospitals will have a supply of n95 masks when and where they need it when supplies begin to dwindle! In addition to your support, please forward this campaign to your friends, family members, colleagues and social media contacts. Power rests in numbers \u2013 this is your chance to make a difference! With heartfelt appreciation, (Mark v)",

    "description": "Rom, 19/02/2020  Liebe Freunde,  \u00a0  ich hei\u00dfe Sophia Lilin Wu. Ich bin eine chinesische Laiin und Theologie-Studentin im zweiten Jahr vom ersten Studienzyklus an der P\u00e4pstliche Gregoriana Universit\u00e4t. Wie Sie wissen, erleidet China, besonders Wuhan, das Coronavirus seit Anfang des neuen Jahres 2020. Da dieses Virus so resistent ist, hat es sich auch bald ausgebreitet in anderen Teilen Chinas und der Welt.  Mein Herz bricht wenn ich so viel t\u00e4gliches Leid anschauen muss. Um das chinesische Volk helfen zu k\u00f6nnen das Coronavirus zu bek\u00e4mpfen und insbesondere um meine Verwandten zu helfen, die in der Shandong-Provinz wohnen, habe ich fast 700 Mundmasken gekauft und nach China gesandt (Shandong und Beijing). Einer meiner Freunde in Beijing sagte mir dass sogar die \u00c4rzte und Krankenschwestern in den Spit\u00e4lern heutzutage keine Masken finden k\u00f6nnen, um \u00fcber andere Leute gar nicht zu reden. Darum habe ich versucht Ihnen zu helfen. Ohne Maske kann man ja nirgendswo hingehen wegen den gro\u00dfen Gesundheitsrisiken. Untersucher haben jetzt herausgefunden dass es sogar \u00fcber die Luft \u00fcbertragbar ist in nur zwei Sekunden.   Sie brauchen dringend gen\u00fcgend Masken um ein Grundschutz zu haben. Ich bin einziges Kind. Von meiner j\u00fcngsten Kindheit ab, haben meiner Vater und meine Mutter ihr Bestes gegeben um mir mit den besten Sorgen zu umgeben, in der besten Schule zu erziehen, mich zu ermutigen an der beste Universit\u00e4t Chinas zu promovieren als Doktor in Philosophie, meine Studien der katholischen Theologie in Rom zu unterst\u00fctzen \u2013 obwohl sie selber gar nicht christlich sind. Ihre echte und tiefe Liebe ist was ihr dazu gebracht mich in all meine Entscheidungen zu unterst\u00fctzen. Liebe braucht Gegenliebe. Deswegen entschied ich mich dazu ihnen die beste \u00e4rztliche Hilfsmittel zu geben. Vom 25. Januar, das chinesische Neujahr, bis heute habe ich fast jeden Tag ausgeschaut nach Masken um nach China zu schicken. Bis heute sind schon 700 Masken nach China gegangen. Schwierig ist aber dass die normale Transportwege nach China nicht mehr funktionieren, nur DHL konnte mir helfen diese Masken zu transportieren. Aber das billigste und kleinste DHL-Paket kostet schon 58 Euro. Um eine fixe Pr\u00e4senz von Masken in China zu garantieren, musste ich oft Pakete schicken \u2013 in dieser Monat habe ich fast 500 Euro f\u00fcr Transport zahlen m\u00fcssen. Und wegen der gro\u00dfe Nachfrage, steigern sich die Preise der Masken. Zum Beispiel: eine FFP2-Maske kostete 5 Euro, heute aber schon 10 Euro. Eine FFP3-Maske kostete vorher 7 Euro, jetzt 15 bis 20 Euro. Sie k\u00f6nnen aber nur 8 Stunden verwendet werden. Obwohl manche Freunde mir geholfen haben, habe ich nach eine Monat kein Geld mehr auf mein Bankkonto. I erinnere mich am Abend des 17. Februar, den ersten Tag des zweiten Semester, wenn die Apotheke mir anrief mit der Mitteilung dass sie mehr FFP2-Masken gefunden h\u00e4tten. Mit mein Geld konnte ich aber nur noch 29 Masken kaufen. Dieses Geld war mir in September von meiner Mutter gegeben f\u00fcr mein Lebensunterhalt und Studium in Rom. Se meinte immer dass ich etwas brauche f\u00fcr Notf\u00e4lle, z.B. um Medizinen zu kaufen wenn ich krank w\u00e4re oder ein Ticket nach Hause kaufen zu k\u00f6nnen. Jetzt hat sich aber all dieses Geld in Masken verwandelt. Fr\u00fcher konnte ich mich immer auf meine Eltern berufen wenn ich in Not war. Jetzt aber steht China still. Ich wei\u00df gar nicht ob mein Vater noch ein Gehalt bekommt. Darum entschloss ich mich dass ich diesmal ihnen helfen musste. Liebe Freunde, hilf mir bitte um mein Leben und Studium in Rom weitersetzen zu k\u00f6nnen. Es fehlt nur anderthalb Jahr um meinem ersten Zyklus der Theologie zu beenden an der Gregoriana Universit\u00e4t. Ich habe eine Studienb\u00f6rse die mir ein Unterkommen und Essen gibt, brauche aber etwas Geld f\u00fcr die n\u00e4chste sieben Monate (bis September): f\u00fcr Scans, Kopien, f\u00fcr die Vorbereitung von Anfragen f\u00fcr eine neue Studienb\u00f6rse und um Tickets von und nach Krakau zahlen zu k\u00f6nnen im Sommer. Ich tr\u00e4ume n\u00e4mlich nach meine Studien in Polen zu leben und zu arbeiten, darum habe ich schon ein Aufenthalt in Polen geplant im Sommer, um Polnisch zu studieren. Die Studienb\u00f6rse f\u00fcr das Polnisch-Unterricht deckt aber keine Transportkosten.  Der Glauben an die Sch\u00f6nheit der Menschenherzen treibt mich an dieser Brief zu schreiben. Wie das Lied der Olympischen Spiele in Beijing 2008 es ausdruckte: du und ich, Herz zu Herz, wir sind Familie.  Ich danke Ihnen von ganzem Herzen und glaube dass Gott ihre G\u00fcte vergelten wird!",

    "description": "Rome, 19/02/2020  Chers amis,  \u00a0  Je m'appelle Sophia Lilin Wu. Je suis une \u00e9tudiante de th\u00e9ologie chinoise, maintenant dans la deuxi\u00e8me ann\u00e9e du premier cycle \u00e0 l'Universit\u00e9 Pontificale Gr\u00e9gorienne. Comme vous savez bien, la Chine, en particulier Wuhan, souffre du virus corona d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de 2020. Vu qu'il est tr\u00e8s r\u00e9sistent, ce virus se r\u00e9pands bien vite dans d'autres parties de la Chine et du monde.  Face \u00e0 cette d\u00e9tresse mon c\u0153ur se rompt. Pour aider le peuple chinois \u00e0 combattre ce virus et en particulier pour aider ma famille qui habite dans la province de Shandong, j'ai achet\u00e9 presque 700 masques et je les ai envoy\u00e9s \u00e0 Shandong et \u00e0 P\u00e9kin. Un ami \u00e0 P\u00e9kin m'a racont\u00e9 qu'entretemps m\u00eame les m\u00e9decins et les infirmi\u00e8res dans les h\u00f4pitaux ne trouvent plus de masques, pour ne pas parler des autres. C'est la raison pour laquelle je cherche de faire mon mieux pour leur donner un coup de main. En effet, on ne peut pas bouger sans masque \u00e0 cause des grandes risques de contamination. Les chercheurs ont entretemps retrouv\u00e9 que le virus se r\u00e9pande m\u00eame dans l'air dans seulement deux secondes.  Tout de suite ils ont besoin d'assez de masques pour garantir une protection minimale. Je suis enfant unique. De ma premi\u00e8re enfance jusqu'\u00e0 maintenant mon p\u00e8re et ma m\u00e8re ont fait leur mieux pour me donner tout dont j'avais besoin: une \u00e9ducation dans la meilleure \u00e9cole, l'encouragement \u00e0 obtenir un doctorat en philosophie \u00e0 la meilleure universit\u00e9 de Chine (l'Universit\u00e9 de P\u00e9kin), le soutien \u00e0 \u00e9tudier la th\u00e9ologie catholique \u00e0 Rome (bien qu'ils ne sont pas chr\u00e9tiens).C'est leur amour r\u00e9el et fort qui les a pouss\u00e9s \u00e0 me soutenir toujours. Amour redemande amour. Ainsi je me suis d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de leur donner les meilleures aides m\u00e9dicales. Du 25 janvier, la nouvelle ann\u00e9e chinoise, jusqu\u2019aujourd'hui j'ai cherch\u00e9 des masques \u00e0 envoyer en Chine. Entretemps 7000 masques sont en train d'y partir. Mais \u2026 les cargos normaux ne partent plus pour la Chine, seulement DHL pourrait m'aider. Leur paquet le plus petit et le plus \u00e9conomique coute n\u00e9anmoins 58 euros. Pour garantir un r\u00e9serve de masques en Chine je dois leur envoyer tr\u00e8s souvent des paquets. Ce mois-ci ca m\u2019a cout\u00e9 presque 500 euros. A cause du besoin le prix des masques augmente beaucoup. Auparavant un masque ne FFP2 co\u00fbtait que 5 euros, maintenant on a besoin de 10 euros. Un masque FFP3 co\u00fbtait 7 euros, maintenant 15 \u00e0 20 euros. Et \u00e7a ne peut \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 que durant 8 heures. Bien que certains amis ont contribu\u00e9, apr\u00e8s un mois je n'ai plus d'argent sur mon compte bancaire. Je me souviens le soir du 17 f\u00e9vrier quand la pharmacie m'appelait parce qu'ils avaient trouv\u00e9 d'autres masques FFP2. Mais avec ma carte bancaire je ne pouvais plus acheter que 29 masques. Cet argent, qui n'y est plus, m'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 par ma m\u00e8re en septembre pour financier ma vie et mes \u00e9tudes \u00e0 Rome. Ma maman voulait que j'aurais toujours les moyens de m'acheter des m\u00e9decins si je tomberais malade ou de me procurer un ticket pour tourner chez moi. Maintenant tout cet argent-l\u00e0 s'est transform\u00e9 en masques. Auparavant je pourrais toujours me tourner vers mes parents si j'\u00e9tais dans le besoin. Maintenant la Chine s'est bloqu\u00e9e. Je ne sais m\u00eame pas si mon p\u00e8re re\u00e7oit encore un salaire. Ainsi je me suis d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de les aider moi-m\u00eame, cette fois-ci. Donc, chers amis, je vous demande de m'aider \u00e0 continuer ma vie et mes \u00e9tudes \u00e0 Rome. Ainsi je pourrais finir mon premier cycle de th\u00e9ologie \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Gr\u00e9gorienne. J\u2019ai une bourse d\u2019\u00e9tudes qui me procure aussi l\u2019h\u00e9bergement et de la nourriture. C\u2019est donc seulement une petite aide que je vous demande pour ces sept mois (de maintenant jusqu\u2019\u00e0 septembre)\u00a0: j\u2019ai besoin d\u2019un petit peu d\u2019argent pour faire des scans et photocopies, pour pr\u00e9parer les applications pour une nouvelle bourse d\u2019\u00e9tudes et pour les tickets de voyage en \u00e9t\u00e9 entre Rome et Cracovie. Je songe d\u2019aller vivre et travailler en Pologne apr\u00e8s mes \u00e9tudes, donc durant l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 j\u2019ai un voyage d\u00e9j\u00e0 programm\u00e9 en Pologne pour y \u00e9tudier le polonais \u2013 mais la bourse n\u2019inclut pas le voyage.  C\u2019est ma foi dans la beaut\u00e9 des c\u0153urs humaines qui me pousse \u00e0 \u00e9crire cette lettre. Comme l\u2019exprimait la chanson des Jeux Olympiques de P\u00e9kin 2008\u00a0: toi et moi, c\u0153ur \u00e0 c\u0153ur, nous sommes famille.  Merci de tout c\u0153ur \u2013 Dieu vous r\u00e9compensera votre bont\u00e9.",

    "description": "Hello everyone, as most of you know I recently moved to China to start a new chapter of my life. \u00a0Once my father passed away I knew even more-so that this change was needed in my life. It\u2019s something I was so desperate to do not only to change my life for the better, \u00a0but to make myself and my family proud. Each day I wake up thankful to be here, thankful that I went through with this dream and continue to make my dad proud.\u00a0 Since the CoronaVirus decided to appear, not only has the world come to a stop still but also my mind and mental health as abruptly come crashing down. So much so I\u2019ve contemplating giving up this dream completely, so much so that Im sleep depriving myself, so much so that anxiety and panic attacks have become second nature. Then I think about leaving again, something I know will make me feel like an even bigger failure. During this outbreak it has left me uncertain of how I might continue to not only have a roof over my head, \u00a0but cover basic needs such as food and water. The virus has stopped all schools from opening, which in turn means us teachers are left with nothing. As it stands the schools are not due to open any time soon which does mean basic living necessities will be something I no longer have access to. Food and water will no longer be a viable option, let alone having somewhere to live.\u00a0 All I\u2019m asking for is help, in any way shape or form. Every penny counts, and I will use whatever funds are raised to cover living expenses as well as manage to feed and water myself. Any further funds that I manage to raise will goto a charity that helps individuals in crisis situations. I don\u2019t expect anyone to donate however if you choose to, just know that I am beyond grateful. I will forever be truly thankful \u2665\ufe0f",

I would like to make the world a better place because I\u2019m sick of bullying, people dying, racism, and much more horrifying scenes. I want to start a Gofundme to find a cure for the coronavirus. Vietnam, Korean, Japan, American, Some Chinese, and more don\u2019t deserve to catch this virus at all! I understand SOME Chinese people who eat exotic animals kind of deserve this, but after seeing some footage and videotape, I\u2019ve seen some terrifying stuff. I\u2019ve seen a DAD cried because his NEWBORN baby had catch the virus, and the baby totally did not deserve it to catch the virus! I really just want this virus to stop because I hate seeing people dying, more reasons to bully, and racism. All my money I\u2019ve earned from this will be given to committees who are trying to find a cure to the coronavirus. Anything will help. Even some cent!

    "description": "Hello and thank you for visiting my campaign.  My name is Felicity Stanway and since June 2018 I've had the amazing opportunity to work in the beautiful city of Guilin as both coach, consultant and technical director of Golden Saddle Equestrian Club. It has been both a challenge and a joy in helping to raise the awareness of horse welfare and best work practices whilst educating the next generation of coaches and riders in what was a fast growing equestrian industry in the economic powerhouse that is China.    The goals at Golden Saddle were to become one of the leading equestrian educators in the country with the focus being on educating the local industry about best world practices for horse welfare, riding and coach education, whilst also being a sustainable learning centre for the greater public connecting people with the wonderful healing powers of the horse.\u00a0     The outbreak of the COVID19 virus it has created an unplanned industry crushing scenario.\u00a0 With the whole country in lockdown up to 70% of all businesses country wide have been forced to cease operations having what will be a national economic crisis. Ultimately this means that Golden Saddle along with many other equestrian clubs and businesses are trying to survive without any income.\u00a0\u00a0 The unfortunate situation that sets a business such as Golden Saddle apart is that in such a shutdown with 48 horses needing care the club cannot simply lay off staff and close production until things blow over. The horses still need care and exercise and all the daily chores still need doing.     I've created this fund to help the man that has shared with me his vision, Mr Yu, my boss, known by his English name Kerwin.\u00a0\u00a0 He had a dream at a young age to own his own horse club, and in October last year he made the very bold decision to buy out the other partner in the club in order to be able to have full control over the clubs future and entrusting the horses welfare and management to me.\u00a0 Unfortunately due to the virus outbreak and after much consultation the tough decision was made that I was to come home amidst the fears that the virus spread and lockdown would potentially continue for an unspecified amount of time and the financial future of the club was in question.\u00a0     Kerwin has been the most supportive and enthusiastic boss and it has been heartbreaking coming home and leaving my team and the horses behind with the fate of their future unknown.\u00a0 My goal of this Go Fund Me campaign is to raise enough funds to help support Kerwin over the next few months in keeping the club running whilst China recovers from this horrible unforeseen tragedy. Thankfully before the new year the club had purchased enough feed supply to keep the horses going to until at least the end of March, it's the staff costs that will be the main outgoings. With a fulltime staff of 6 coaches and 4 support staff, who are all currently in lockdown living at the\u00a0club, my dedicated former team are already willing to sacrifice part of their pay just to stay and keep the club going.\u00a0 These people have not only been my work colleagues over the last 18 months they have become my family, so although I am now not able to be with them my goal is to help keep them all employed and give the club the best possible chance of recovery for the future.         Your donations will be massively appreciated and contribute not only to the Golden Saddle club but the future of horse welfare in China starting with the wonderful 48 horses that call Golden Saddle home.  There will also be plan for the future to create a website where you will be able to check in and virtually meet all of the Golden Saddle staff and horses personally and see the difference your donation has made.  So in conclusion I would like to personally thank each of you for reading my cause and donating to keep Golden Saddle alive, and hope that one day you may get a chance to visit the team at Golden Saddle and take pride in the knowledge that you helped keep an amazing dream alive.",

The incident has spread rapidly not only in China but also in the world. Until today, the epidemic doesn't seem to be optimistic and has a high degree of chances to worsen as well as getting critical. Therefore, as overseas Chinese students, our Chinese Student and Scholars Association (CSSA) would like to take the lead to hold a fundraising event.

So far, China has restricted travel for several provinces which is approximetely 35 million people. The incubation period of Wuhan Coronavirus is very long (1~2weeks) which is why it's spreading so fast all over China and globally. Japan, South Korea, the United States, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, the United Kindom, and Austrilia all have cases detected.\u00a0   People in Wuhan are all in danger. All hospitals are overcrowded, public transportations are shut down, N95 face masks are all sold out. All hospitals in Wuhan and surrounding areas ran out of medical resources, including N95 face masks, medical gloves, medical protective clothing, and surgical glasses. Due to the Chinese Lunar New Year, lots of students and workers in Wuhan went back to their hometown, which means they have possibly brought the virus to all their family and neighbors!\u00a0   All money will be used for sending medical tools for hospitals in China, mostly for small areas that have not gotten enough help yet. The donation process will be 100% public and transparent, I will keep everyone updated of every single step I've made. Thank you so much for your help.",

    "description": " We are Infecting Ourselvs \u00a0  If you have been following the\u00a0 the Coronavirus outbreak, you may remember Dr. Li Wenliang. He was the whistleblower\u00a0 doctor who tried to\u00a0 worn others about the a new Coronavirus were showing up in patients eyes.  Dr. Wenliang was an ophthalmologist who first identified the Coronavirus as patients with severe infection in one or both eyes were presenting. He saw the relationship between these unusual eye infections and this developing into pneumonia.\n\n \u00a0\n \n\n The world was saddened by his death after constructing the Coronavirus now known as Covid19.\u00a0     People are Infecting Themselves \u00a0  The virus is spread through hand to face or hand to eye contact. People are touching infected\u00a0 surfaces\u00a0 such as\u00a0 door knobs ,\u00a0 elevator buttons\u00a0 grocery carts and many other hard surfaces. It has being proven that the coronavirus can live on hard surfaces as long as 9 days.\u00a0  If someone is infected with the Coronavirus and coughs into their hands or is simplimatic the transmission occurs when you touch that same door handle then rub your eyes. This is how coronavirus is spread.      Doctors Urge Patients to Wash\u00a0 \u00a0Hands Frequently\u00a0   Doctors are urging the public to becone more vigilant and aware of the surfaces they are touching. Any surface especially hard surfaces which are touched frequently may be contaminated with the Coronavirus. In a busy setting such as a school or office building, hundreds of people are touching the same door handles railings and other hard surfaces then touching their face and eyes.   The Average Person Touches Their Face 2,000 Tines a Day   Several studies have shown that on average we touch our faces between 1,200 and 2,000 times each day. We must become much more aware our habit of touching door handles and other common areas then touching our faces or rubbing our eyes. Dr. Li Wenliang said \"If we can't break the habit of touching our faces we will never beat Coronavirus\".    Wearing Googles Prevent Hand Eye Contact \u00a0  \u00a0 Wearing goggles is one simple measure we can take two dramatically decrease the speed in which this virus is spreading. The goggles will also remind us not to touch other areas of the face.   3D Printed Goggles \u00a0      People who are blind generally touch more surfaces then\u00a0 the average sighted\u00a0person. This dramatically increases the chances they will become infected.   You might remember me mentioning my interest with 3D printing. Right now I have all of my available printers replicating goggles of all sizes. I can currently\u00a0 print 40 sets of goggles\u00a0 each day. I desperately need more printers to meet the demand. I am also emailing the files to anybody with a 3D printer who wish to produce goggles for their friends and families.\u00a0   \u00a0I am handing the googles for free to anybody who is in need. I am asking others with 3D printers to do the same.   I have established a GoFundMe account to help cover the cost of filament and other expenses expenses associated with\u00a0 making and distributing the goggles.     gf.me/u/xkzvw9  Below is a short 3 minute video warning about hand eye contact.    https://youtu.be/DfGyYrtTheI     Here is an in-depth 21 minute video that discusses the issue in greater detail.    https://youtu.be/DPkLApDRJME",

    "description": "\n Dear Friends,\n \n\n  The Coronavirus (COVID19)  continues to spread throughout the world. Controlling the spread requires the mobilization of our combined efforts to fight the threat of the pandemic. A glaring problem is that there is a possible shortage of medical supplies including N95 respirator masks. The biggest producer (China) is the epicenter of the virus and might not have enough for themselves much less for the rest of the world. This means that if the virus spreads to more countries, there will be a global shortage of N95 masks. Without proper protection, individuals will be more likely to contract the virus spread it to even more people.\n \n\n   Article on demand for 270 million face masks \u00a0 \n \n\n One possible solution is to create improvised respirator masks. These masks would have to be relatively cheap to make from household materials. One possible design is an improvised gas mask with Cut 2-Liter soda bottle, duct tape, rubber bands, cloth, and crushed charcoal. Such a design will help prevent contracting the virus not only from airborne contaminants but also preventing the user from touching their face which is also an entry point of the virus through their eyes, nose, mouth. This simple design could be made by anyone willing any improvements would be most welcome.\n \n\n My proposal would be to use modern technology and methods to mobilize efforts for distributed production of improvised respirator masks. Using shared Google Sheets and Google Forms, orders can be grouped by city and zip code.\u00a0 Facebook marketplace could also be a place to advertise. \"Manufacturers\" would buy materials and construct the masks. Customers would fill Google forms and be matched with local manufactures who would then, like Uber/Postmates, deliver the masks. To mitigate legal/fees, transactions would be made by cash(after being disinfected)/venmo/paypal upon delivery accounting for material/labor costs. Hopefully, healthy competition and innovation will mitigate price gouging that is inherent in emergency scenarios.\n \n\n The purpose of this fundraiser is to incentivise action and create infrastructure around the project in order to scale properly and hopefully globally. Money donated will also be given to manufacturers to create masks for local hospitals in areas affected. Hopefully, together we can ensure action to fight this impending threat and provide a glimmer of hope to those affected.\n \n\n \u00a0\n \n\n  Thank you for your support.",

    "description": "The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has infected 71,334 people worldwide. 1,775 people are now known to have died from the virus. Six health workers have died and 1,716 have been infected since the outbreak. In Wuhan, where the virus was first detected, 242 people died on the 13th February alone.    As a group of academics at  Cardiff University , we are in solidarity with our fellow collaborators in\u00a0 Hubei Cancer Hospital in Wuhan  who are working against the clock in fighting the coronavirus and saving lives. We particularly wish to support our Chinese colleagues by funding protective equipment for frontline medical staff due to their critical shortage of medical resources. These individuals are working tirelessly to protect us, so it is vital that we protect them.     Before the outbreak, Hubei Cancer Hospital was supporting us on various projects including early cancer diagnostics using circulating biomarkers and evaluation of cancer immunotherapy effectiveness. We had two PhD students working in Wuhan since November 2019 on these collaborative projects.    In view of the increasing number of coronavirus infected patients in Wuhan after the initial outbreak, Hubei Cancer Hospital started to provide healthcare service to severely infected cases and reported their critical shortage of protective equipment.    All the donations will go solely to purchase NIOSH-certified N95 respirators and other protective equipment for medical staff in Hubei Cancer Hospital.\u00a0 We hope more patients can receive effective treatment when adequate protective equipment is in place for medical staff. The control of the coronavirus in Wuhan is important to stop further transmission to the other countries.       The fundraising team of academics in Cardiff University aim to acquire the medical equipment using the fund and send it to Hubei Cancer Hospital by March 2020.\u00a0 At the end of the fundraising, we will circulate a report of the use of the fund to all contributors.\u00a0  We are grateful for your support.

We are fortunate to have received support and to be closely working with Wharton alumni in China, including the founder of 1 Drugstore (111.com.cn, NASDAQ:YI) which is one the largest direct online pharmacy networks in China.   Our current plan is to procure medical supplies through our network in China (and potentially internationally) and to directly deliver to the designated treatment hospitals in Wuhan where the most urgent needs are.  GCC commits to providing 100% transparency to the entire process, including (1) providing prompt updates to donors on final destination of funds, (2) providing a donor-by-donor list of donations at the end of the fundraising process, and (3) engage in ongoing Q A and updates on progress of fundraise and supply procurement process, within reason.   Given we are a student organization and have no official bank account, we will be withdrawing money into the personal bank account of Eileen Gao, one of the GCC board members. The funds will be converted from USD to RMB and sent to our supplier and logistics partner 1 Drugstore's corporate account via international wire transfer. We will provide update on proof of receipt and transfer of funds when we have the details.   * Kind reminder: the platform may prompt you to enter a tip which is not related to our donation campaign. Please select \"Other\" if you do not wish to tip the platform in addition to your donation.    Current facts    The number of lab-confirmed cases stands at 14,000 in 23 countries as of February 2.

To help dispel some prevailing myths around the coronavirus:    Myths: Corona is the most dangerous virus that exists Facts: The common flu kills 60 times more people annual than Corona \u00a0 Myths: I will die if I am diagnosed with the coronavirus Facts: An estimated 2% of cases have reported deaths and most of these deaths were associated with weaker immune systems (e.g. old age) \u00a0 Myths: I need to buy a hazmat suit and a N95 mask to stay protected Facts: Washing hands and sneezing into elbows are best practices to protect yourself \u00a0 Myths: We all need to stay away from anyone from China Facts: Coronavirus has an incubation period of around 2-14 days. Therefore if a person of Chinese descent has been living outside of China for the last 14 days or more, he/she is at no higher risk of transmitting the virus than anyone else in the broader community. \u00a0 As the virus has spread in China, and especially in Wuhan, hospitals reportedly have been inundated with suspected cases, and have rapidly run out of critical medical supplies, most importantly protective facial masks and suits. Below are recent official statements released by some of the hardest hit hospitals in Wuhan, appealing directly to the public for donation of medical goods.  At the same time, many governments around the world have imposed strict travel restrictions to and from China, and some have placed export restrictions on critically needed medical supplies by the abovementioned hospitals in Wuhan.  Whilst we appreciate and acknowledge the need for the efforts made by national governments to protect their own citizens, we believe times like this are when true compassion and humanitarianism need to shine through the dark clouds.    Thank you.",

    "description": "Hello There, My name is Kenji Portillo. I was diagnosed with asthma since the day I was born. As you know a new virus (Covid-19) is going around. I am trying my hardest to prevent myself from getting it.\u00a0 Whats my goal?\u00a0 My goal is to livestream and make content for YouTube from home and gain enough money/support to be able to quit my job. I currently work at Five Guys and come in contact with many people daily which adds to my chances of becoming ill due to the virus. I also want to help others that this virus may be affecting. How would I help others? Using some of the money to buy basic supplies for people that can't afford it (Face Masks, Gloves, Cleaning Supplies...ETC) Helping the homeless out during these times is something I really want to do as well. It's easy to be selfish around these times and homeless people will be very susceptible to it. You can email me if you wish for more info and how to help: HuffziProductions@gmail.com",

    "description": "Dear good people of the world,  I am a licensed clinical social worker and therapist in San Jose, California, LCSW 93644.  I am an immigrant myself from Daegu, South Korea and my relatives and mother still live in Daegu.   Daegu's corona virus epidemic news tells that three main emergency rooms at three hospitals have been closed/reopened due to serving patients in the last three weeks. I've heard that many public health doctors, who are medical corps non-combat physicians, are obligated to serve for treatment at Daegu, in South Korea, but they had not been provided any hotel expenses.  My hometown, Daegu, South Korea is in great stress for utilizing medical staff at hospitals in the area.   I would like to help medical staff in the hospital at Daegu so people in my hometown may get served properly.   Would you join me?   I will donate money to medical staff at hospital and doctors in Daegu, South Korea.  Hope I can raise the money by the end of March, 2020.   According to the Korea Times,   \"The Daegu medical infrastructure is under great stress,\" he said. \"They may be as exhausted as those in Wuhan. You can't let them hang out to dry\"   https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2020/02/119_285142.html    https://www.wsj.com/articles/american-soldier-contracts-coronavirus-in-south-korea-as-government-struggles-11582706980   Today, at the New York times, I read an article relating sufferings from Syrian refugee children, donated little money to Syrian non-profit organization, Violet.   Why not my hometown Korea, this evening, my thoughts are in my hometown and what I can do for my friends, extended relatives, neighbors where I grew up.",

    "description": "Autumn is our sweet kitten. She has been diagnosed with a fatal disease which is caused by the corona virus is cats. This isn\u2019t the same disease that humans can catch and is not contagious to humans. Sometimes this virus mutates and becomes known as fips. There are different types of fips but in Autumn\u2019s case it has mutated into wet fips. The disease causes fluid build up in their organs and eventually leads to death. However there is a drug called mutian that is known to cure the disease but it is not yet available at vets throughout the world. Kittens must take the medicine for 84 days for full treatment and in most studies the majority of cats have been cured from this horrible disease. We are asking for donations to help us afford the cost of the medicine. Currently it is costing 25 dollars a day but as Autumn\u2019s weight increases so will the dosage so it will cost more per day. We are on day 18 and have seen how well the medicine has worked for our Autumn and we really want to be able to treat her the full 84 days and give her a full life. Please donate if you can if not please just share this post so we hopefully raise enough to be able to purchase all 84 days of medication. Thank You!",

Transportation suspended, postponed and cancelled for the fear of spreading the virus. Businesses shutting down because their revenue streams have stopped or slowed so much they can\u2019t afford to pay the employees. People who work in the service industry feel the effects of this and are feeling it hard. Tips, which many in the industry depend on has come to a halt and the income they depend on to feed their family, pay the rent, and buy food has stopped. They are struggling to provide the same basic needs you and I have yet can\u2019t because their revenue stream has come to a halt.   I know people in this industry who are telling me this is exactly what is happening to them. They reside in areas of countries where the yearly income is less than $9000 a year. When their revenue comes to a halt, it hurts, it really hurts. We feel the need to reach out and help and We can\u2019t do it alone. Its the human thing to do, right? To help those as we would want help if were are in need. There is something said for there is power in numbers.\u00a0   That is where this fund and you come in. You have the opportunity to help. With your generous donation, you will provide those who are currently harmed by this event with a form of revenue. Your donation will be distributed among those hit hard. It will provide the needed help that will allow them to feed their families, make that payment for rent, buy medicine and more. It\u2019s not the long term solution, that will come when the world gets the virus under control. In the meantime, with the help from people like you, we can provide some amount of relief that will get them by one more day.\u00a0   Bless you for your gift. It means a million to them.",

    "description": "We know there have been other GoFundMe campaigns started, but none from Southern CA. Lets show everyone that we care (not just Southern CA).   ***UPDATE***  The Organizer Team (made up of Real Estate Professionals) has received official endorsements from: China Institute of Real Estate Appraisers and Agents (CIREA) China Alliance of Real Estate Agencies (CAREA) and we are expecting multiple others. Endorsements can be viewed at:   https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jagcamh39kxt48y/AACdwoPNSU4K1qQqjrtHCIa7a?dl=0     ***UPDATE 2***  Our first shipment has been sent out on February 18, 2020 and included 53x N95 Face Mask Respirators, 825x Face Mask Respirators, 24x Safety Glasses, and 81x \"Sealed\" Safety Goggles. Purchased and shipped via Mexico and ETA February 28, 2020. Shipments have been sent to Beijing in order to be distributed to Wuhan and Hubei region where it is needed the most.   WHY DONATIONS ARE NEEDED:  Now more than ever we all need to stand up and show our support to combat this Global Crisis that coronavirus has caused and continues to cause. This is not limited to just China/Asia and effects are starting to show around the Globe; socially, culturally, and economically.\u00a0  OVER 70,000 individuals have contracted the virus, and while the bulk of cases are in China, cases are spreading all over the Globe.  -Many cities in China are in \"lockdown\" mode with many residents afraid to even go outside (even to shop for daily goods). Posts floating around the internet show Beijing and Shanghai looking like a ghost town. Over 50 Million residents in Wuhan City and Hubei Province are in lockdown. -Chinese New Year Holiday (also known as Spring Festival) which is traditionally a time of celebration and visiting friends/family has been detrimentally affected. Many restaurants, stores, malls, amusement parks (Both of Asia's Disneyland's), shopping malls, etc have been voluntarily closed down until further notice to help reduce the spread of coronavirus. The CNY has officially been extended to keep part of the workforce from going back to work. Schools have been out and will be off indefinitely until the situation improves. -Multiple Global airlines have reduced or outright cancelled their China routes to help combat the spread of coronavirus, some as far as May 2020 (Delta, United, American Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Air India, etc). Chinese travel agencies were given a mandate by the government to cease travel bookings/operations until further notice with hefty fines if they continue business -Multiple counties have restricted access from travelers traveling from China.    HOW TO HELP:  Step 1: Donate here, any amount will be a GREAT help in this time of need.  Step 2: We will collect the money raised to purchase N-95 masks, surgical masks, protective goggles, gloves, gowns, and other in-demand medical supplies. -Supplies will be purchased both locally in USA and within China to be shipped directly to hospitals in need. -Funds will be disbursed to local Organizations/Associations within Wuhan and Greater Hebei Province (including Social Welfare Groups, Medical Assistance Groups, etc)  Step 3: We will ship the supplies directly to Wuhan, China and/or surrounding areas! As well as work only with trusted and reputable organizations/associations. (FYI that Red Cross China unfortunately is NOT the most reputable and has been scandal ridden in recent years. They have a huge inventory of facemarks that they refuse to distribute, sitting in warehouses).  Step 4: We will provide photo proof/receipts as funds are used or disbursed.\u00a0 Dropbox link with photos/documentation:\u00a0 https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jagcamh39kxt48y/AACdwoPNSU4K1qQqjrtHCIa7a?dl=0    VOLUNTEERS NEEDED: \u00a0 -help spread this GoFundMe campaign -source local avenues to purchase listed medical supplies at wholesale price, as well as locate cheaper options for freight shipping goods direct to affected areas in China -identify organizations/associations within China that can best disburse donated funds to assistance most needed in China -contact  spencer@thehoogroup.com \u00a0or  robertmiller@robertmiller.com \u00a0to inquire and be added to our volunteer team.

Directions on our Burn Bags will be clear:\n \n\n \"Burn Bag\" is to be burned in a safe area before opening.\u00a0 A water source should be close by should fire to extinguish fire if need be.\u00a0 Fireplaces, barbeque grills and metal trash cans are ideal for this purpose.  At this point, the food we deliver will be free of any risk of coronavirus contamination.",

While scientists are working to develop anti-virals and a vaccine, it won\u2019t be widely available in the near future.  Please consider joining us and supporting the efforts in fighting against the Coronavirus today.

Due to fear and misinformation surrounding the Pandemic many people who need Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) are not getting it.   PPE such as the  N95 Respirators  have been  sold out  across the world. According to the CDC the best way to prevent the spread of the virus is to wash your hands, don't touch your face, and cover your mouth and nose when coughing/sneezing.   Individuals who really need the mask are  health care providers  treating the sick and  those who have the virus!     I will be collecting new/unused N95 masks and raising money for shipping of the masks worldwide to hospitals and areas of confirmed cases. Please don't buy masks for yourself! Send them in so people who really need them can have them!   Please donate and help stop the spread.  *Shipping address to Follow*  Sources:   https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/healthcare-supply-ppe.html#who-needs-ppe",

    "description": "The decade of the 2020s has finally arrived. In the first month of this year, however, a sudden outbreak of the  novel Coronavirus  turned the entire world into a mess and put everyone on alert.  This novel Coronavirus is a contagious virus originated from Wuhan, China that can cause symptoms such as fever, cough, breathing difficulties, pneumonia, severe respiratory syndromes, and even death.  It expanded rapidly after it was developed through  different ways of transmission including animals to humans and humans to humans,  just like how common cold is spread. \u00a0Several countries around the globe including  China, United States, Japan, Australia, France, Germany, Canada, Singapore, Malaysia, Korea, and Finland  were already found to be infected with this lethal virus.\u00a0  According to the Chinese government officials, t his novel Coronavirus first appeared in a seafood market on December 12, 2019. Within a short month, the number of people who are confirmed to be infected with this coronavirus had already become 14,628 along with 305 deaths.  The number has continued to climb higher and on January 30, 2020, the  W.H.O (World Health Organization) declared the outbreak of this novel Coronavirus to be a global health emergency.  Starting from February 1, 2020, t ravel to China was restricted  and this would lead to  huge economic downfalls   in every single country, especially China.\u00a0    Currently,  tons of doctors and medical workers were fighting against the Coronavirus at the front line, and many of them had sacrificed their lives . With a tremendous amount of infected patients,  China and many countries were facing medical shortages.  Most of the hospitals in China  desperately need supplies including masks, goggles, and protective suits .  Without these types of equipment, the medical workers can be easily exposed to the Coronavirus and this can make the situation worse.    So, we need your help! We appreciate everyone that is willing to participate in this fundraiser and  all of the generous contributions from you will be used to purchase protective medical equipment including protective suits, N95 masks, and medical goggles.  They could also be sent to China and  help scientists in research for the cure to this lethal virus.  All of these were in  urgent need for those medical workers in the front line.  We will  ensure all funds that we received will be used to purchase these types of equipment \u00a0and we will update the processes.\u00a0   Let\u2019s all fight against the Coronavirus together and pray for Wuhan!",

    "description": "  See our website \u00a0  Coronavirus Disease 2019, commonly known as 'Coronavirus' or Covid-19, has fallen into our lives, firstly was as a problem for others:\u00a0 In China there was a strange pneumonia epidemic, derived from bats or snakes.....one of the many news on TV!. \u00a0 Our lives continued to flow regularly, nothing seemed to be able to shake them so deeply, so quickly, as it actually happened within a weekend; that will remain forever etched in the memory, mine and of millions of other people.\u00a0  A weekend during which in northern Italy, psychosis spread freely, without any type of government filter, perhaps placed to protect businesses, from microscopic ones to multinationals. The media screamed all day long in an emergency, causing a panic reaction in the population, who rushed to stock up on food even if we were at war, deserted the streets, shops and restaurants. The same news was then reported by the media from all over the world, in fact generating what is today the real national emergency, or the inevitable and strong \"economic crisis\" that will affect most anyone who has to do with incoming tourism in Italy. DEFINITELY throughout 2020.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"My name is Stefano Santaiti, and I am the General Manager of Villa Patriarca hotel, in Mirano (Ve)\".  A beautiful Venetian Villa from the 1700s; located in the lands of Tiepolo, in Mirano, a town full of historic parks and enchanting places absolutely to be seen, a few minutes from Venice. We have infected people very close but none of them are here in our municipality/town.  However, Coronavirus IMMEDIATELY brought us enormous economic hardships.\u00a0 We had 95% of the rooms booked canceled. The prospect, UNFORTUNATELY, is to close FOREVER our VILLA..would be a tragedy not only for me but also for the families of all my staff, on average 20 people.  My pride prevents me from asking for charity, even in this difficult situation, therefore I had this idea:\u00a0 \u00a0 Selling 'social' vouchers: let me explain better: anyone who wants to help us not end up in the middle of a road, will receive an 8-year voucher for the same amount, which can be spent in any of our services: pizzeria, restaurant, hotel, swimming pool.  Basically, if you want to support us, you will have a unique opportunity: You will have helped good people in difficulty due to this situation, and in return you will receive a voucher valid for 8 years (the residual duration of my rent-contract) That you can use here our beautiful property when you will want and, I will have the opportunity to shake your hand and thank you personally on behalf of all the staff, for helping us in a moment of extreme need.   Thank you.\u00a0  ---------------------   Guarda il nostro sito web \u00a0  Il Coronavirus Desease 2019, comunemente detto \u2018Coronavirus\u2019 o Covid-19, \u00e8 entrato in sordina nelle nostre vite, prima come un problema di altri: nella lontana Cina stava verificandosi una strana epidemia di polmonite, derivata dai pipistrelli o serpenti... una delle tante notizie da Tg.  Le nostre vite continuavano a scorrere regolarmente, nulla sembrava poterle scuotere cos\u00ec profondamente, cos\u00ec velocemente, come \u00e8 poi effettivamente successo nel giro di un weekend; che rimarr\u00e0 perennemente impresso nella memoria, mia e di altre milioni di persone.  Un weekend durante il quale nel nord Italia, la psicosi ha dilagato liberamente, senza alcun tipo di filtro governativo, posto magari a tutela delle imprese, da quelle microscopiche alle multinazionali. I media hanno urlato per tutto il giorno all\u2019emergenza, provocando una reazione di panico nella popolazione, che si \u00e8 precipitata a far scorte alimentari nemmeno fossimo in guerra, ha disertato le strade, i negozi ed i ristoranti. Le stesse notizie sono poi state riportate dai media di tutto il mondo, generando di fatto quella che \u00e8 oggi la vera emergenza nazionale, ovvero la inevitabile e forte crisi economica che colpir\u00e0 maggiormente chiunque abbia a che fare con il turismo incoming in Italia. Sicuramente per tutto il 2020.  Mi chiamo Stefano Santaiti, e sono il gestore di Villa Patriarca hotel , a Mirano (Ve)  Una bellissima Villa Veneta del 1700; posta nelle terre del Tiepolo, a Mirano, cittadina piena di parchi storici e luoghi incantevoli assolutamente da vedere, a pochi minuti da Venezia. Abbiamo dei contagiati molto vicini. Ma nessuno qui nel comune.  Ciononostante Il Coronavirus ci ha messi in ginocchio. Abbiamo avuto la cancellazione del 95% delle camere prenotate. La prospettiva \u00e8 quella di chiudere, che sarebbe la rovina , oltre che per la mia, anche per le famiglie di tutti i nostri collaboratori, in media 20 persone.  L\u2019orgoglio mi impedisce di chiedere la carit\u00e0, anche in questa difficile situazione, pertanto ho avuto questa idea:  Vendere dei voucher \u2018sociali\u2019: mi spiego meglio: chiunque vorr\u00e0 contribuire a non farci finire in mezzo ad una strada, ricever\u00e0 un buono valido 8 anni di pari importo, spendibile in qualsiasi nostro servizio: pizzeria, ristorante, hotel, piscina.  In pratica, se vorrete sostenerci, avrete un\u2019occasione unica: Avrete aiutato delle brave persone in difficolt\u00e0 a causa di questa epidemia , e riceverete in cambio un buono valido 8 anni ( la durata residua del mio contratto!) da poter usare qui da noi quando vorrete, in modo che io possa avere l\u2019occasione di stringervi la mano e ringraziarvi personalmente a nome di tutto lo staff, per averci aiutato in un momento di estremo bisogno.   Grazie.   Lo staff  Villa Patriarca Hotel   Mirano (VENEZIA)",

As more coronavirus cases are reported, demand for face masks will increase \u2014 as will their prices there's already been some serious price  Authorities cut most transport links to the central Chinese city last week to try to halt the spread of the flu-like virus. Thousands of cases have been reported in China, with a small number in countries including the United States, Thailand and Singapore.  The unprecedented move prompted people in the city of 11 million to rush to supermarkets to stock up on instant noodles, vegetables and whatever else they could put their hands on.  Residents say there has yet to be an acute shortage of food, although shelves are cleared quickly when goods arrive.  Shouguang, the country\u2019s biggest vegetable production base, in the eastern Shandong province, has been asked to deliver 600 tons of fresh vegetables to Wuhan every day in the next 10 to 15 days, said an official in Sunjiaji, one of Shouguang\u2019s villages.  Sunjiaji, whose main crop is cucumbers, was tasked with sending 60 tons in less than seven hours.  China\u2019s largest food and agricultural firm COFCO Group and China Grain Reserves Corporation (Sinograin) Group have stepped up supplies of rice, meat and cooking oil to Hubei province  wuhan You need this kind of help to provide masks and food for the most needy",

We are fortunate to have received support and to be closely working with Wharton alumni in China, including the founder of 1 Drugstore (111.com.cn, NASDAQ:YI) which is one the largest direct online pharmacy networks in China.   Our current plan is to procure medical supplies through our network in China (and potentially internationally) and to directly deliver to the designated treatment hospitals in Wuhan where the most urgent needs are.  GCC commits to providing 100% transparency to the entire process, including (1) providing prompt updates to donors on final destination of funds, (2) providing a donor-by-donor list of donations at the end of the fundraising process, and (3) engage in ongoing Q A and updates on progress of fundraise and supply procurement process, within reason.   Given we are a student organization and have no official bank account, we will be withdrawing money into the personal bank account of Eileen Gao, one of the GCC board members. The funds will be converted from USD to RMB and sent to our supplier and logistics partner 1 Drugstore's corporate account via international wire transfer. We will provide update on proof of receipt and transfer of funds when we have the details.   * Kind reminder: The platform may prompt you to enter a tip which is not related to our donation campaign.

    "description": "Hi, my name is Kimberly and I'm 48 years old and I have congestive heart failure and COPD. For the past two years I have been unable to work due to my illness and even though I have applied for social security disabilility, it does take time to go through the process. I'm very concerned about the Corona virus outbreak . Due to my underlining conditions it would probably be fatal to me.\u00a0 I have no way to buy masks or gloves or any kind of hand sanitation to help protect against this virus. I am a resident of Washington state and there are now 10 people in our county that have tested positive and several dozen more who are being tested. none of us want to become a statistic and we prevent that by helping each other. a pair of gloves and a papermask to you, might be life to another. any help would be much appreciated. If you are someone in this position who also needs help please contact me and I will do what I can to help you also. Thank you very much for taking the time to read this and please keep you and your family healthy.",

    "description": "  https://metro.co.uk/video/south-koreans-queue-buy-face-masks-covid-19-outbreak-2117030/?ito=vjs-link  \u00a0  Hello, everyone!  My name is Sung Jo, and my friend's name is Katherine Ko. We were born and raised in the very mothering land of South Korea, but we both study and live in the United States. Our friends (including Frances Chow, part of this fundraising team) and my children (5 and 7 year old boys) would like to do something to help South Korea overcome the outbreak of COVID-19 ( Coronavirus).    South Korea is experiencing an exponential rise in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, particularly in the city of Daegu, the fourth largest city in the country. South Korea just announced 334 new cases, bringing South Korea\u2019s national tally of the virus to 1,595. (Feb. 26, 2020)  As a result of the sudden and rapid increase in the number of infections in South Korea, they are already out of surgical masks and protective gowns.    PLEASE HELP doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel working in the region and the citizens in South Korea.  Your donations will be used to purchase N95 masks, procedural masks that have 99% viral filtration, and medical/surgical gowns. Our goal is to raise enough money to get 1,000 N95 masks, 1,000 medical gowns, and 500 bottles of hand sanitizers. We will ship all of these supplies to South Korea via an express shipping company.  WE WILL REPAY YOUR KINDNESS. Thank you so much for your consideration.

    "description": "Due to the coronavirus breakout in China, many communities and towns are locked down to keep the virus from spreading. People from my hometown, which is a small town in far northwest of China called Qitai, are confined into their own homes like other cities for over one month. This has created great difficulties for people who have not much savings for emergencies like this. I just heard from my dad, who is currently working as a security guard for the community center, that a lot people called the center everyday because they don't have the basic necessities to get by each day, food, water, money to pay for electricity, gas and wifi, etc. wifi is needed because kids are schooled via internet at home due to the emergency. The center is trying their best to help, but it's not enough. I am currently studying in the University of Leeds in UK, so there is only so much I can do for the community I grow up in myself because I spend almost all of my money in this study. I am really grateful and sending enormous amount of love for anyone who could chip in to help my community and I am also grateful if you feel called to help but not be able to, my love and gratitude goes to you all as well. The money raised will be used to buy flour powder, rice, cooking oil, which are the most basic food people in my hometown eat everyday. Only the most basic food will be bought for them because I am thinking to help as many people as possible to survive first \u00a0and if I can raise more, vegetables and meat will be bought to help them. I don't have photos or videos available at the moment due to the lockdown, but I will try to post them to help keep you updated with the process as soon as possible. Thanks again for all the help and kind hearts out there and much love to you all.xxxxxxxxxxxx...",

My Dad, however, who health is already in extremely poor condition, is right in the middle of it in China. He's 70 years old and is already on oxygen from a pulmonary embolism he had a year ago... at the moment, he's told me that most shops have closed down and the streets are empty due to the virus and most people are choosing to confine themselves to their homes so as to avoid the spread. He and his wife have both lost their jobs and struggling to make ends meet... He's a very proud man, so hearing him admit this much terrifies me. I've tried to offer my own financial support at times also, but he's far too proud to ask for help... But I'm not. Please help. I've never considered making one of these myself, and probably wouldn't if it were only for myself... but it's for my Dad. He's always worked so hard to make sure his family have always had everything they've ever wanted, despite being in a detrimental relationship that ended with him losing every cent to his name...\u00a0 He has almost nothing to his name and I would give anything to have his last few years on this earth without the stress and worry of how to buy food for the week...\u00a0 Thank you for absolutely anything you can afford to give...  3",

So far, there is no cure or vaccine for the virus, which has infected more than 80,000 people and killed more than 2,700 worldwide in the past few months. News of the drug testing came Tuesday, just as a federal health official warned that the virus will eventually start spreading in US communities. A clinical trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the antiviral drug remdesivir in adults diagnosed with coronavirus started at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, the National Institutes of Health said. The first participant is an American who was evacuated from the Diamond Princess Crew ship docked in Japan. Also on Tuesday, top officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned about the potential spreading of coronavirus in the US.",

While I have been focusing on the positive side that we are healthy, I realize that Corona Virus has a more disastrous impact than we all expected. While South Korea has been handling the virus outbreak greatly so far, patients and front line medical responders in high risk and quarantined areas still need supplies and continued support as the crisis unfolds. I setup a GoFundMe page and I\u2019m hoping that all of you who know me, or like my work can donate. I will start posting photos that I took through the years in different parts of the world, or photos of things that touched me in a way or another. \u00a0When you see a photo you like, please send me a message and I will send you the digital file in high resolution along with a link for you to print. Once you print it, I hope this will be a memory of you making a small, but big impact for others in this terrible crisis. \u00a0Any amount of dollars you can donate will help!! My hopes and prayers go out to all the families affected and especially to all the nurses, doctors, scientists, who work selfishly to fight Coronavirus.  Let\u2019s do this together!! Mari",

it destroyed my adrenal glands.\u00a0 In November 2016, I stopped taking the active folate.\u00a0 After two months, my body came off my \"active folate high\", revealing that my adrenal glands were destroyed.\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Since January 2017, I have had debilitating and chronic fatigue.\u00a0 I cannot just take iron pills or energy drinks to recover.\u00a0 My fatigue is so bad that after typing about fifteen to thirty minutes, my wrists will become very painful from fatigue.\u00a0 I cannot do office work.\u00a0 I am even too tired to read most books that I find enjoyable.\u00a0 This is not laziness or a lack of will power, but a major physical disability.\u00a0 Sustainable and meaningful recover requires a long process of supplements and treatments arranged by the famous specialist in adrenal fatigue, Dr. Carrie Lam of Orange County, California. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My health is so bad that in the very likely case that I catch the coronavirus, I am almost certain to die from it even though I am 36 years old.\u00a0 This is because it affects mainly old people and those with pre-existing conditions - exactly like mine.\u00a0 Therefore, I am desperate to find a way to recover from the coronavirus, as well as to help my parents pay my medical bills for Dr. Lam.\u00a0 I could not accept money from strangers unless I had some pretty precise and well-thought out plans, which I am rapidly working to devise.\u00a0 \u00a0My current plan is to go out into a very sparsely populated rural area and either rent a small cabin/apartment for three months or to live in a tent if necessary in a state park.\u00a0 I will consult multiple doctors to see if this is a sound idea.\u00a0 I believe I could do this for as little as $2000-$3000.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I would be as grateful as any man can be for somebody saving my life from certain death, which is basically what they would be doing as far as I am concerned.\u00a0 Right now, I depend on my parents for all my needs, but my parents, even though I love and respect them, are not competent or prudent.\u00a0 They will probably die from the virus too, but they are not taking it seriously.\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 I would try very hard to pay my donors back and if necessary, I could get on the dole so my private donors wouldn't have to pay for my food.\u00a0 I have never had an aptitude for planning, but I have a lot of talent and I am still idealistic enough that I am willing to undergo a lot of hardship.\u00a0 I have a strong belief in personal responsibility, but I was too idealistic, unrealistic, and lonely in college to have the sense to study on Sundays.\u00a0 I have some Presbyterian, Scotch-Irish blood in me and as a result, I am stubborn and self-reliant to a fault.\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now, though, I desperately need help to save my life.\u00a0 I am ashamed to ask for help, but I did refuse to get on the dole or on Social Security disability for 11 years.\u00a0 I could have been on the latter for five years with perfect justification, but I hate asking others for money.\u00a0 I will try very hard to repay you.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I am still very idealistic, but for twelve years I have been fully aware that I must match my idealism with a very strong work ethic and that I was mistaken in college about studying on Sunday.\u00a0 In certain, real ways, I have never had much of a chance in life.\u00a0 My idealism was based on the idea that America was in desperately bad shape and needed timeless wisdom to recover.\u00a0 I still think America could benefit from the world's best source of not-so common common sense, Aristotle, if that makes sense.\u00a0 Aristotle has been called \"the common sense philosopher\".\u00a0 Reading him, and other old classic western books, is key to being conservative.\u00a0 This important idea is promoted at Hillsdale College, which I deeply respect.\u00a0 Democracy is collapsing, but that is something the founding Fathers themselves realized would happen after 1789.\u00a0 I strongly believe that based on the thought of Plato; Aristotle; the first Duke of Wellington (the British soldier who defeated Napoleon); and Hans Hermann Hoppe.\u00a0 While I am a patriotic American, supporting the 2nd Amendment and other bedrock American institutions, I believe America has always been decadent and doomed to collapse relatively quickly.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I want to make the world a much more beautiful and happier place.\u00a0 I have a lot of talent and a lot of the kind of deep, classical, western-based learning that our universities should be trying to promote instead of rampant political correctness, socialism, and other non-western ideas.\u00a0 I even used to have great physical charisma, the remnants of which I still hope to use to get married and transmit to my children some day.\u00a0 I would be willing to marry a woman from a poor country, if necessary.\u00a0 Maybe my [future] children [since I have never slept with anybody or otherwise had children] can use their charisma to become famous leaders and spread a love of morality, personal responsibility, and liberty to future generations.\u00a0 I'm not pretentious or arrogant, but very humble and embarrassed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Unfortunately, I would love to have enough money to head to the hills as soon as possible.\u00a0 I would have been planning this a month ago, but my health is bad enough that I could not plan as quickly as I wanted.\u00a0 Yes, I am goofy and very awkward, but as goofy as I am, I can do enormous good with my life.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0PLEASE HELP ME SAVE MY OWN LIFE.",

Pochi, purtroppo, sono a conoscenza delle condizioni in cui versano le palestre e i centri sportivi italiani in questo momento.  Nelle regioni settentrionali ,  le palestre sono state chiuse a causa del virus e per questo gli istruttori di sala (come personal trainer) e gli istruttori di nuoto sono senza stipendio da settimane . Le piccole palestre rischiano la chiusura e migliaia di persone rischiano il posto di lavoro. Se gli istruttori non lavorano, non guadagnano neppure un fisso mensile.  In pi\u00f9, al momento il governo sta promettendo di stanziare aiuti economici solamente per le zone rosse e, anche l\u00ec, ESCLUDENDO totalmente questo settore. Ma i centri sportivi che sono stati obbligati a chiudere sono presenti in tutte le regioni pi\u00f9 colpite dal Coronavirus.  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n Io purtroppo non posso aiutarli  da sola, per questo rivolgo a tutti voi questa piccola richiesta di aiuto, sperando che possa poi ingrandirsi e raggiungere pi\u00f9 persone possibile.

This is a page to help raise not only money to help the family with his medical expenses, but to also help raise awareness and prevent other incidents like this from happening again and maybe shedding some knowledge to some that it's ok to continue learning from those who are knowledgable and willing to help in certain areas. We want to help and allow Devon to experience life without restrictions. Please take the time to read this incredible young man's journey. He is wise beyond his years and stronger than most his age. \u00a0\u00a0  \"On the morning of January 15th there was an accident in the weight room at Academy High School which resulted in the amputation of my pointer and middle finger. As you can imagine this has been very traumatic for me and some days are worse than others, and it will continue to get worse for me mentally for a little while. Actually varies moment by moment. I expect to return to school when I am released to do so. Due to the anxiety of this situation, I am asking to please not ask me questions about the accident when I return, it may cause me to replay the moment in my head and that won\u2019t end well. I will open up and talk when I am ready, please respect my privacy and space. I look forward to returning to my normal activities but I will be learning my new normal. While I am prepared this will take some time, I will be very quiet and sad, and at times very frustrated, please just understand I need time but I know I will be stronger and better than ever before I know it. I will continue to be in athletics of course and this only inspires me to work harder in what I do, but I do hope the school district does what they should do to make the weight room safer. I am grateful because it could\u2019ve ended in worse circumstances. I am also extremely grateful it was me that it happened to instead of any of my fellow loved classmates, this way it\u2019ll bring the districts attention to the situation and they could easily prevent it from happening to anybody else. I\u2019m very worried about everybody, but I understand everybody is worried about me as well, so thank you so much for your support and love during this extremely difficult time. It helps me during this time. The encouragement of family and friends that have visited and checked on me mean more to me then any of you will ever know.\" -Devon Hulsey",

    "description": "A few years ago, I raised money to help kids across our state by eliminating their school lunch debt. I took action because I saw a need. Collectively, I knew we could do something about it. And we did: We wiped out lunch debt in schools across the state of Minnesota.  Today, we\u2019re facing a bigger challenge. The coronavirus is hitting Washington hard. Unfortunately, 29 people have died and 366 people have tested positive, according to the Health. Government officials warn it could reach 64,000 in a few months if our leaders do not take the steps necessary to stop the spread of the virus.\u00a0  We hope and encourage our government officials to do all they can to test, treat, and prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\u00a0  People need immediate help. During this crisis, those with the least suffer the most. Some folks can\u2019t go to the doctor because they don\u2019t have healthcare. Public schools are closed for at least two weeks and some people can\u2019t afford to take off work because they don\u2019t have paid sick leave. Some parents have to choose between paying the rent and feeding their kids.\u00a0  This will get worse before it gets better. But the good news is that there\u2019s a path forward.  You may wonder, like I have, if there\u2019s anything we can do to help. We don\u2019t have to sit idly by waiting for someone else to solve the problem. We can take action. We need to come together and lift up the folks that need a helping hand.\u00a0  I recently read about the Minnesota Foundation\u2019s COVID-19 Response Fund. The Seattle Foundation is an important organization providing direct relief to those that need it most. They will provide money to \u201cresidents without health insurance and/or access to sick days, people with limited English language proficiency, healthcare and gig economy workers, and communities of color, among others.\u201d The Fund is working closely with King County\u2019s Pandemic Community Advisory Group to identify organizations currently providing or receiving requests for support and will use the money raised on our campaign to assist with these efforts.  I will not have access to the funds. Every dollar donated will be transferred directly to the Minnesota Foundation. Your donation is tax-deductible.\u00a0  Please join me in becoming part of the solution. Donate $5, $10, or $25 bucks. Every contribution counts.

The disease has spread to many other countries, the Novel Coronavirus has killed more than 3,000 people worldwide, majority in mainland China. There have been more than 88, 000 global cases, with infection on every continent as of 1st of March.  The residents of China have been experiencing a shortage on N95 Respirator Face Masks which can greatly aid in the prevention of the Virus \u2018 spread.  With this fundraiser, we hope to raise funds in order to purchase N95 Respirators Face Masks which we will send to organizations in Wuhan China as well as other affected areas.

    "description": " We Are The World   Outreach To Find   Cure COVID-19  We are raising money to test our proposed cure (clo2) for the pandemic known as covid-19. We think we already have a cure, but it must be tested on the the actual virus. All procedes will be used towards this end. CLO2 is the chemical compound that has proven to be effective in killing many bacteria   virus infections. The FDA has approved its use for many things including mouthwash, but refuses to approve it for it's health benefits. It's so  inexpensive  to buy that companies cannot sell it and make money. Anyone can make it by combining to compounds which are available world-wide.  Our non-profit group is ready to go anywhere to test the clo2 cure for this pandemic.\u00a0 We just need the support   approval of the World Health Organization or the infected countries approval, to allow us to test it. Clo2 has been used for decades, but it's efficacy for medicine has never been proven,\u00a0 due to the millions of dollars required by the FDA , CDC for companies to mass produce it.  The History of Chlorine Dioxide\u00a0 ( CLO2  the proposed  cure  for COVID-19)   Chlorine Dioxide \u00a0was discovered by Sir Humphrey Davy in 1844. The British chemist combined potassium chlorite with sulphuric acid. It will soon be discovered that this green gas would be a more effective disinfectant than chlorine.   By the 1930's Chlorine Dioxide  was being used more frequently for disinfecting areas. Because of it's gaseous form, it filled spaces evenly. The volitile gas was impossible to ship safely, so Sodium Chlorite began to manufactured as a relatively safe precursor chemical, and the industries using chlorine dioxide would then generate the gas onsite as needed. Because of Chlorine Dioxide's solubility in water, it starts being used as a water treatment.   In 1944, Chlorine Dioxide  was used by the City of Niagra New York, to control odor and remove phenols from the river water used as the municipal supply to good effect. The city soon changes to Chlorine Dioxide exclusively. The water is cleaner, tastes better, and has no odor compared to the use of chlorine.   In 1956 Brussels Belgium makes the switch from Chlorine to Chlorine Dioxide  for it's municipal water system. It is discovered that Chlorine dioxide will destroy algae biofilm, a feat which Chlorine could not accomplish.\u00a0   Through the 1960's  more cities and swimming pools start to change to  Chlorine Dioxide .   In 1967 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A) registered an aquaeous form of Chlorine Dioxide  to be used as a sanitizer and disinfectant. Chlorine DIoxide starts being used commercially on fruit and produce as a sanitizer.   In the 70's and 80's The EPA began reccomending Chlorine DIoxide  over Chlorine for water treatment and other applications. This was due to the fact that because of their different chemical properties, Chlorine Dioxide was more efficient, and did not produce toxic trihalomethanes like chlorine.   In 1988 the EPA registered Chlorine Dioxide  as a sterilizer approved for hospitals, laboratories, and healthcare facilities   In 2001 FEMA and other government agencies use Chlorine Dioxide  to to decontaminate buildings contaminated with Anthrax. \u00a0Chlorine Dioxide was completely effective against the tiny Anthrax Spores. The buildings, walls and furnishings suffered no damage from the treatment.   In 2005 FEMA again uses Chlorine DIoxide . This time to eradicate mold from damage caused by Hurricane Katrina. A restuarant in New Orleans was able to re-open after being treated for just 12 hours without major repair.   The products, uses, and applications for Chlorine Dioxide  continue to grow. More and more mainstream health and home related products are using chlorine dioxide. There are several patents issued for companies to use Chlorine Dioxide to make personal and household products.\u00a0   As of January 2020\u00a0 the FDA, CDC,\u00a0 and other US organizations continue to forbid use of Chlorine Dioxide  as a medicine because of a lack of interest for corporations to make enough money to market it as such.\u00a0 Simpley said, the clo2 is so plentiful that anyone can make it. No company would ever be able to patent it. Therefore people die.  Will billions of people die now because it is too cheap for rich people to get richer? We suggest that one of the billionairs running for office donate clo2 to the world now!    WE ARE THE WORLD  (please save us)   FDA APPROVES CHLORINE DIOXIDE FOR WATER \u00a0   FDA APPROVES CHLORINE DIOXCIDE AS FOOD ADDITVE \u00a0   FDA APPROVES CHLORINE DIOXIDE FOR FOOD PREP \u00a0   FDA APPROVAL LIST OF CHLORINE DIOXIDE USE",

    "description": "\n \u00a0 \u00a0 Hello everybody! Our names are Alan and Ceren. We have been living in China for almost 5 years as English teachers. Currently, we are in Xiamen, Fujian Province.\n \n\n We have two adopted dogs:      This is Munchies. He is 4 years old. We found him as a 2-month-old puppy in Beijing, Wudaokou area. He has been a part of our family since then.    And this one is our \"Girl\" aka Miss Paws. We found her starving on the street in September 2019, in Xiamen. We have been trying to find her a forever family but unfortunately, we couldn`t find anybody.\u00a0 (The picture above is a part of the poster we prepared before for the adoption.) So, now she has become the newest addition to our family.  Until January 2020, everything was going nicely in our lives. But then,\u00a0  the Coronavirus outbreak has started and everything turned upside down.\u00a0 We are living under a nationwide quarantine. Finding masks and supplies is difficult. People couldn`t go to work for almost a month.\u00a0 Most companies resumed working on the 19th of February in most provinces, but schools are still closed and there is no specific starting date.\u00a0\n \n\n Out training center has been hurt by this deeply and we still have not gotten our salaries for January and February. Our management keeps telling us the only thing we can do is to wait until schools reopen, but even after that, there is no guarantee that they will pay us.\u00a0  Right now the only thing we are trying to do is get back to America, yet with our current financial situation, it is not possible. We need to buy plane tickets not only for us but for our pets which currently is more expensive given the situation.\u00a0 Our options are limited by the lack of airlines flying to China.\u00a0 Also, the paperwork which is required for our\u00a0 dogs to get on the planes is very expensive. We had considered staying longer yet with our rent and daily expenses we are not able to support ourselves. We already used all our savings and currently, we are surviving by the money our families have lent us and need to find a solution as fast as possible.  This unexpected pandemic is hurting everybody in a different way. We\u00a0 just want to go back home and be safe. Leaving our dogs behind is not an option.\u00a0   Please help us get home, we only have one month to finish everything and move our lives to America. We have lived here for five years and this has been one of the hardest things we have ever had to do. Our lives are here in China and to leave this all behind has been a challenge for us both mentally and physically.",

    "description": "As the current rates of the coronavirus grow exponentially, higher than any other virus outbreak in history, the risk of mankind is at risk. By reducing interactions from human to human through a hazmat suit, we as a human race will be able to prevent and slow down these sky-rocketing rates. By raising these funds, hazmat suits will be donated to areas around the world currently such as Italy and Wuhan, China, to help doctors and medical professionals in need of sterilized equipment and apparel. As simple household medical supplies are being sold out and the current ones in stock have tripled their price and sometimes even quadruple, lower economy households will not be able to purchase these necessities themselves. So not only will these funds help with purchasing hazmat suits, but they will also help to give households around the U.S. simple things like hand sanitizer and soap. This is a critical issue in our society RIGHT NOW and we need to act fast, or else this will become a pandemic that people were just ignoring for the past couple weeks.",

    "description": "I love my parents.\u00a0 They are the heart and soul of our family... and we want to keep them around for as long as possible.  Over the weekend, a Coronavirus outbreak occurred in Kirkland, Washington - a city not far from where my parents live.\u00a0 Today, Wednesday, March 4th, King County Public Health officials urged that the following groups of people should stay home: - People 60 and older - People with underlying health conditions including heart disease, lung disease, or diabetes - People who have weakened immune systems - People who are pregnant  Though my parents don't feel like it and don't realize it, they are actually considered \"elderly.\"\u00a0 (Shhhhhh!)\u00a0 Additionally, my dad has respiratory issues which seems to make him more susceptible to pneumonia and lung infections.\u00a0 Since the outbreak, I have been urging them to stay home, but with little success.\u00a0 They love to volunteer in the community, as it fills them up and keeps them busy.  My 15-year-old daughter reminded me that over the past month they have binged watched some shows on Netflix that kept them so enthralled that they actually stayed home for hours at a time.\u00a0 I had an \"a-ha\" moment.\u00a0   So, this morning - after urging them to pack up their Vanagon and just go camping for the next month or two (they laughed that idea off) - I passed along a list of shows they could binge on Netflix, with the idea that this might keep them busy and help them to be more content staying home and not volunteering out in the community.\u00a0   They really love crime dramas, mysteries, thrillers, British mysteries and thrillers.\u00a0 They are - at this very moment - watching Harlan Coben's \"Safe\"... but I know that soon they will run out of shows from my Netflix suggestions list to watch!  So, I am trying to raise some money for them to get subscriptions to BritBox, AcornTV and Hulu so that they can possibly get sucked in and forget that hours, days, weeks are passing by... all the while the Coronavirus can do its thing and my parents can remain healthy.  And while I am doing this a bit tongue in cheek, I am also doing it because I want my parents to know that they are cared about, valued and loved beyond measure.\u00a0 Any donation you can make towards these entertainment subscriptions would be so appreciated.\u00a0 Any suggestions or other ideas would be appreciated, too!  Thank you!\u00a0 Stay healthy and be well out there.\u00a0 Hug your parents!",

This novel Coronavirus is a contagious virus originated from Wuhan, China that can cause symptoms such as fever, cough, breathing difficulties, pneumonia, severe respiratory syndromes, and even death. It expanded rapidly after it was developed through different ways of transmission including animals to humans and humans to humans, just like how common cold is spread.  Several countries around the globe including Italy, China, United States, Japan, Australia, France, Germany, Canada, Singapore, Malaysia, Korea, and Finland were already found to be infected with this lethal virus. \n\nAccording to the Chinese government officials, this novel Coronavirus first appeared in a seafood market on December 12, 2019. Within a short month, the number of people who are confirmed to be infected with this coronavirus had already become 86,657 along with 2305 deaths. the W.H.O (World Health Organization) declared the outbreak of this novel Coronavirus to be a global health emergency. Starting from February 1, 2020, travel to China , Italy , Iran, South Correa was restricted and this would lead to huge economic downfalls in every single country. \n\n\nCurrently, tons of doctors and medical workers were fighting against the Coronavirus at the front line, and many of them had sacrificed their lives. With a tremendous amount of infected patients, China and many countries were facing medical shortages. Most of the hospitals in China desperately need supplies including masks, goggles, and protective suits. Without these types of equipment, the medical workers can be easily exposed to the Coronavirus and this can make the situation worse. \n\nSo, we need your help! We appreciate everyone that is willing to participate in this fundraiser and all of the generous contributions from you will be used to purchase protective medical equipment including protective suits, N95 masks, and medical goggles. All of these were in urgent need for those medical workers in the front line. We will ensure all funds that we received will be used to purchase these types of equipment and we will update the processes. \n\n\nLet\u2019s all fight against the Coronavirus together",

    "description": " Imagine being overseas in another country with your wife and son,\u00a0 and finding out you have been stranded!  Government travel bans have caused Airlines to cancel tickets, without refunds/exchanges.    This Journey actually Began\u00a0 way back in 2013. I came here to volunteer and help out. I taught, and helped multiple pastors during that time. I also married my best friend. She had been in my life, although from a distance for a long time. My time for departure was arriving and I was spending the last of my money I had extra over what i would need to eat, gas in car to get to work etc.     Dengue Fever  didn't care about any of that! A mosquito bit me contaminating my body with the Dengue Virus causing massive loss, along with a deadly brutal sickness.\u00a0     Missed flight-2013  was a horrid disaster. My visa expired a few days after the missed flight. While I laid sick bedridden my visa expired adding violation fees to the necessary extension fees. The Missed flight was a disaster. No money, and no way out. The airline even agreed to just let me standby fly out for another $150.00 if could leave that same week. Yet my body wracked with pains and fever was not up to the task of travel even if it meant getting better.   I Survived Dengue,  and after seven more months of living on an average of around $30.00 per month, losing nearly 80 lbs, I was helped by a great fellow from a church to make it back to the states.     Another Virus, CoronaVirus seeks\u00a0 to wreak havoc in my life. That is why I brought up the Dengue experience. I lost my vehicles, tools for my business, furniture, clothes. I lost everything the first time with Dengue Fever. Due to being destitute I couldn't file papers to bring my wife home as we planned, being destitute meant leaving finally when I was helped, by myself to work and climb my way back up.  I paid all the loans back and slowly got back on my feet. It was a multiyear nightmare. Living on a hundred dollar per month food budget, no clothes budget, car budget, etc.    My family suffered being torn apart  for two years of only small contact with phonecards and Facebook Messenger.\u00a0 Then at three years I was able to scrounge enough to visit 2 weeks on a poverty budget. The next year I filed papers to bring my wife and they told me I needed to prove I made enough, I thought well does the asylum seekers need enough financial support? They come mooching having never paid taxes, I have paid taxes since 14 years of age and never taken even unemployment. So this seems wrong, not saying don't help asylum seekers and those that need, but don't then discriminate against your own citizens. Her being here would increase income, and keep my earnings in the country instead of the need to send a big portion to her to live.   Today I sit scared  as my wife and son were finally going to come. With our last appointment at the embassy my wife is coming home! I want her to fly same flight, it cost a lot as most seats are booked on my flight.    Flight Canceled  with no recourse, or solution in sight. \u00a0I don't have enough to replace my ticket, not even a dream or fantasy I will find a way or be blessed enough to get my wife and son replacement tickets too on a route and flight not canceled or high CoronaVirus locations.     I am asking,  even though I never have been a mooch and don't even know how, and really doubting anyone will care, and finding this hopeless, I am asking for your help.     Please\u00a0 help me get home so I can work, pay my rent and not lose all that I have worked these long hard years to get back. If possible I would like to raise $1,000 to get the ticket with aisle seat(I'm wide wont fit in economy except aisle). Yes I am cheap I fly cheap seats except for choosing aisle. I don't know if that is enough even as each day the prices change, and with more and more canceled travelers looking I expect it to become higher.\u00a0 That is the minimum, it will get me home to work, then hopefully In time I can get my wife a ticket and son and they will get home too.   Best option  would be finding way to bring them too by raising enough to pay their airfare also.\u00a0 Her visa is at stake as she has a window to enter the USA and waiting excessive time they sometimes wont even grant the whole window. I leave that up to you folks. I am no mooch but I am desperate as I am work injured an cannot work for the monies I used to when younger and healthier. I wouldn't recover from losing everything again.   Some Pictures Follow   One thing Great Happened while stuck in the Philippines, I watched my son be delivered.\u00a0 It happened at a small midwife clinic in middle of nowhere. Was scary, like out of the 1800's.    Last visit i was finally able to afford taking family and extended(2 sis in-laws and niece)to eat at a American quality equivalent restaurant. Was amazing cost around $16 per person but was better than any buffet i have been in America. They still are thankful, and smile so big when Vikings is brought up. For folks who make $2 or so a day with food costs at or around Americans(to buy they just don't buy the same foods eating lot cheaper than we do), they really appreciated it. As you can see I'm wearing a bulk pack white tee, I have learned from them to budget a lot more strictly.    For years I missed Birthdays and Christmas for not only my wife, but my son too. This was really hard for him. He wants to drive a backhoe so Papa can be home more. I cried when I heard that. I work hard, don't get drunk or waste money. Sometimes I wonder why has to be this hard. Work injury took my career away where I made enough to really provide a descent(not rich or even well off)life. I made 50-65k as a truck driver OTR.\u00a0 I switched to a local job so i could be with family when they came but the Union company turned out to be a not a great choice.  I was hurt and was their fault they even admitted as much, I am permanently injured and Doctors say unlikely to drive a truck again. The company didn't even pay the light duty work. Just refused forcing me to have to work or die of starvation and family hate me when they can't eat because I didn't send money. My injury is real, my pain is real, yet because they could force me to have to work just to survive they haven't even paid the surgery that would fix my shoulder to a point it may be possible to work again at 30% chance.  Some say I have lived a life under a black cloud of bad luck, Eric a great friend of mine says he has never met anyone with as bad a luck as I have. I may have bad Luck and it may seem like there is no hope, so what, each day is a new day it may just get better.\u00a0  I for one would like to believe I am done missing birthdays and Christmas presents getting opened and seeing my son smile. He is honor role and does try so hard even he has ADHD so bad like his dad(me). We are teaching him to learn to self adjust so he can function normally, something I only learned about in twenties and have learned through personal experience does work, but takes work and time.     Hopefully Last Airport parting\u00a0 was what I thought and believed before this travesty happened. Each time I flew out we took the pic here at the plaque outside the airport. Each time it was miserable and hard. Lost my house, all my business equipment and tools, clothes, just about everything else. I didn't lose the most important thing, my family. I may lost time I will never get back, but I still have my family. If you read this far please help, even its so small a gift, or just sharing to your church Facebook page etc.\u00a0 I have never collected a dollar on one of these, but I have given hundreds to help others, I did it even broke as I was, I knew others might be better off, but that doesn't mean they care.  Thank you all for reading my sob story, it is hard and I thank you for your time, thank those who gave, I know you didn't have to, thank you.",

Currently, I\u2019ve been facing some hard ships here in South Korea due to the coronavirus outbreak. Due to my visa, I\u2019m only allowed to work and apply for certain part time jobs after a certain point in time of living here. I\u2019ve been working random tutoring jobs and gigs to stay afloat while living here so far and I\u2019ve lost all of those students due to the Coronavirus outbreak here in South Korea. The country is in a state of emergency, and for myself and certain other expats, we can\u2019t find work anywhere.\u00a0\n \n\n I\u2019ve worked so hard to secure my spot here in South Korea, and my spot at Korea University, an Ivy League university. School has also been delayed because of the virus, and I\u2019m in such a state of limbo. We will start to attend classes online in 2 weeks but my lap top has been broken for months, and I have no money to fix it.\u00a0  My journey here in South Korea has already been financially challenging, but at this time I\u2019m at a loss. Any donations to help keep myself a float at the moment are very appreciated. Everyone stay safe, and thank you for your kindness.  -Skylar :)",

    "description": "Summary A new coronavirus named COVID-19 has spread across multiple continents and infected thousands of people. The virus has caused more than 3,000 deaths, primarily in China. Donations to this fund will help stop the spread of COVID-19 and support response efforts. (Please note: We cannot accept donations originating from Mainland China in accordance with the Law of the People's Republic of China on Administration of Activities of Overseas Nongovernmental Organizations.)  Challenge It is critical to stop the spread of the virus and provide medical care to those who need it. Patients and front-line medical responders in high-risk and quarantined areas need supplies and continued support as the crisis unfolds.  Solution Donations to this fund will bring services to affected communities and help stop the virus's spread. Initially, the fund will help meet immediate needs for healthcare, food, and water in partnership with our nonprofit partners. As the situation unfolds, it will transition to support longer-term education and recovery efforts run by local, vetted organizations in affected regions. We will work with our partners on the ground to allocate funds where they're most needed.  Long-Term Impact We believe that organizations that are deeply rooted in local communities are in the best position to provide long-term support for survivors of outbreaks and other crises. By funding the relief efforts of local organizations, donations to this fund have the potential to build stronger response capacity so that these organizations are better equipped to face future outbreaks. EmmaGiving will post reports about how funds have been used and will email these reports to donors.",

    "title": "Supplies Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 Chengdu, China",
    "description": " Please share this gofundme with your friends. We need help   The \" Novel Coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) \" started in Wuhan and spread to the rest of China.  In Chengdu, Sichuan we didn't have many cases of the virus until recently. However now, the virus is spreading rapidly (over 450 confirmed cases) and Chengdu is now under almost complete lock-down by the Chinese authorities. It's the right thing to do, but it's causing massive problems.    By the time the virus lock-down was declared Chengdu stores had already been sold out of face masks, plastic suits and plastic gloves for many days . Now, by law, and enforced vigorously you can't leave your house without a mask, and you really shouldn't shop or do much else without plastic gloves or a plastic suit, but you just can't buy them anymore. \u00a0  Workers can't work, companies can't open because only about 10% of workers are in Chengdu, the rest are stuck in their hometowns. Most stores aren't open. Without a mask you can't go anywhere. It's very bad for elderly people, they don't have the resources to help themselves.   I'm Canadian, and I've been living in Chengdu for about 4 years. I really love this city, and I want to help out. Because I'm a foreigner, many Chinese friends, and Chinese neighbors,\u00a0 and even people I've never met before but have seen walking around my complex have been asking me if I have a source for masks and virus prevention supplies. I didn't but I have found a supply in Hong Kong.   Masks and plastic suits are desperately needed in Chengdu, for medical workers, essential workers and everyday people. People are washing masks and reusing them because of the shortage. Many people just can't afford to buy masks or can't find them to buy even if they have money.   I have found a source of masks, plastic suits, and plastic gloves in Hong Kong, and I can find a way to get them to Chengdu. Good masks cost about $1 per mask, while plastic suits are $3-4. I can get a much better price per unit if I buy more.\u00a0  My plan is to distribute the masks, plastic suits and plastic gloves to the poorer areas close to where I live (south Chengdu) and focus on the elderly, and people who need them the most. The more funds I can raise, the bigger area we can help. If we prevent even one person from getting infected that could prevent hundreds more later.\u00a0   My estimate is that $1000 will buy enough supplies to protect an entire block for a month. Of course, more would be better.\u00a0 I'd love to raise more than that and expand the area and amount of time I can help. I do have friends who will help me distribute it, and our plans will be updated constantly depending on what's happening with the virus. I will also be cooperating with a couple of foreigner organizations here.   The COVID-19 virus is truly an epidemic already, especially in China. We need help immediately. Please help out by hitting the donate button. Every penny helps. If you can help out with $5, $10, $20, $100 it would be so appreciated by me, and by my Chinese neighbors.",

    "title": "Fund COVID19 Action by People with Chronic Illness",
    "description": "As we face the COVID-19 pandemic in the US and worldwide, we all are wondering how we will get through it, individually and collectively. And people with chronic illnesses need specific strategies.  I'll get to the point: I'm working with organizations and people across the country to launch a powerful national network of people with chronic illnesses.  We need your support, your wisdom, and your love -- and if possible, financial contributions.  I've spent most of my life being a part of game-changing HIV, LGBTQ and justice movements.\u00a0 I've founded deeply-effective organizations, coalitions and national networks. I've anchored teams of staff and volunteers, and held responsibilities for budgets and strategies from individual compassionate support to massive direct action.  I am honored to learn from and work with queer people of color who are the generative leaders of disability justice\u00a0 and healing justice movements with the power to transform our society so we all can thrive. I'm a longtime health care activist and journalist with multiple chronic illnesses. I focus on the intersection of health, care and medical systems; structures of power, information and control; and self-organizing networks to mobilize community wisdom and love.  So now -- working with national networks and brilliant organizers, healers and medical professionals -- I'm building a vital network of people living with chronic illnesses and our allies.  We may call it Chronic Illness Leadership For Emergent Times (CIVFET). But what's most important is what we're going to do:  --  We are hosting a video meeting on Saturday. Register at bit.ly/march7webinar\u00a0 (case-specific link).  (Thanks to AIDS United, Black Emotional and Mental Health collective (BEAM), The Counter Narrative Project , Positive Women's Network-USA (PWN-USA), ME Action for your co-sponsorship of the webinar.)  --  We've planned and initiated a rapidly-scalable plan for this network based on emergent strategies and mutual aid. We need your support to move forward as quickly and effectively as possible. As you know, people living with some chronic illnesses and disabilities are at greater risk of acquiring a coronavirus, having a more severe course of it and complications during or afterwards, and higher mortality rates.  And those facing oppression, marginalization and criminalization are most affected by heightened demands on health care systems and supply chains, economic turmoil, and rising stigma and bias.  (take a breath or a pause.)  But queer and trans people have always had to find new paths for our survival.\u00a0 Our strategies for dealing with chronic illnesses, like our communities themselves, are diverse, creative and take nothing for granted.  We are building a small but amazing team of network strategists, health professionals and healers, facilitators, fiscal managers, disaster response pros, project managers and tech experts, communicators and media producers.  Your support goes directly to this team -- which are primarily queer and trans people living with multiple chronic conditions.  Thank you.",

    "description": "\n  We are fundraising for medical supplies to support hospitals in Zhejiang, China in their fight against the recent coronavirus outbreak.\u00a0  3/5 Final Update: This campaign has completed.  Financial and delivery information are available at   https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21ADRpcWPLDO%2DXxTA id=8802A5DE2E5AC593%214777 cid=8802A5DE2E5AC593   . Please also refer to campaign updates for more details.\u00a0   Who are we?  We are alumni volunteers of Hangzhou Foreign Language School. We are working to support our hometown and our country in this Coronavirus outbreak.   How serious is this Coronavirus?  The recently identified Novel Coronavirus 2019(2019 n-CoV), a cousin of the SARS virus, has infected thousands of people since the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The virus has spread to a total of fifteen countries across four continents.\u00a0  Wuhan and more than\u00a0 14 other cities have been locked down and major tourist destinations have been shut down to contain the 2019 n-CoV outbreak. Despite the effort, up to Jan 27, 4581 people have been infected and 105 have died with 6973 suspected. 350,000 people are estimated to be infected by the beginning of February. Hospital services were near collapse under the pressure of people flooding in to be diagnosed and treated. Medical supplies run dangerously low.   Why Zhejiang?  Zhejiang, the province with the largest floating population, is experiencing rapid development of the epidemic and fast growing\u00a0 number of patients. At the same time, its capital Hangzhou, has received hundreds of Wuhan passengers returning from abroad in the past few days and carried out quarantine, isolation and other prevention and control work. A number of hospitals have shouldered heavy responsibility of providing health observation, diagnosis and treatment for Wuhan passengers as well as Zhejiang passengers who flew back on the same flights.  In the past several days, the number of patients confirmed with coronavirus in Zhejiang Province increased dramatically. Zhejiang has become the third largest epidemic area in China. As of Jan 27, 2020, 173 cases of Zhejiang have been confirmed. Doctors and nurses are working around the clock with very little rest. The rapid growing outbreak has left hospitals in Zhejiang in urgent need of medical supplies such as protective suits, N95 masks, etc. We shall not leave the doctors and medical staff exposed in danger. Please join us to extend your love and help to them!\u00a0   How will your donation be used?\u00a0  Donate to help the doctors and nurses in the hospitals\u00a0 get  sufficient medical supplies ! They are fighting to protect all of us,\u00a0 and let\u2019s give our support to protect them!   Due to merchandise availability, our volunteers will be making the purchase at their own expense to ensure we get the supplies, then the finance officer (Beneficiary of the campaign) will reimburse the amount as the invoices indicate. As a result, the withdrawal from the campaign will be going to our finance officer's own personal bank account.\u00a0   Your generous support will be first used to purchase  certified medical protective gears including \u00a0 protective suits and respirators  , and will be distributed to hospitals in Zhejiang, such as First Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University, Second Affilated Hospital Zhejiang University, and Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital.\u00a0\u00a0   Our Plan to get the campaign's donations to the intended recipients  Our volunteers are divided into multiple teams: Campaign Finance, Supply Acquisition, Appraisal, Transportation and Hospital Connection.   Campaign Finance team is responsible for handling all monetary payment and reimbursement for the purchase.   Supply Acquisition team will purchase the certified medical supplies from merchants all over the world through our alumni network after appraisal and assessment by Appraisal team. This makes sure that we are only purchasing those that meet the hospital requirements and standards.   Hospital Connection team will reach out to hospitals in Zhejiang and collect their requirements on the specific protective gears and quantity needed, while Transportation team will coordinate on the delivery of supplies from our warehouses to the hospitals.  Regular updates will be posted on the progress of our purchase orders until all of our orders have been delivered.\u00a0

Patients and front-line medical responders in high-risk and quarantined areas need supplies and continued support as the crisis unfolds.\n\nDonations to this fund will bring services to affected communities and help stop the virus's spread. Initially, the fund will help meet immediate needs for healthcare, food, and water in partnership with our nonprofit partners. As the situation unfolds, it will transition to support longer-term education and recovery efforts run by local, vetted organizations in affected regions. We will work with our partners on the ground to allocate funds where they're most needed.\n\nWe believe that organizations that are deeply rooted in local communities are in the best position to provide long-term support for survivors of outbreaks and other crises. By funding the relief efforts of local organizations, donations to this fund have the potential to build stronger response capacity so that these organizations are better equipped to face future outbreaks. GlobalGiving will post reports about how funds have been used and will email these reports to donors.\n\nGreetings to you all,",

Sayg\u0131lar\u0131mla, Orkun  ----------------------  Dear readers,  Since Covid-19 has hit the world and continues to spread, we are in the middle of the info pollution both on traditional and social media.  Last February, I found myself in a difficult situation where I spend a lot of time to differentiate the correct information from the unreliable ones. Also, I noticed my friends or family members in Turkey, who cannot speak English, did not have one single platform where they can follow the news about SARSCoV2.  That\u2019s why I decided to set up a website, where I collect the updates and information from official sources such as the World Health Organization, official bodies or reliable news organizations:   https://coronavirusu.net/  \u00a0  The website is in Turkish for various reasons: \u2022 There are a lot of people in Turkey can\u2019t follow the English-language sources. We translate them for the Turkish speaking people. \u2022 Information pollution is even bigger when we don\u2019t reach the first source and under the censorship.  My main motivation is to convey official updates and confirmed information to people from reliable sources. I am not adding any personal, political, ideological opinon of anyone. Also, each source used in the website is certainly cited in the website. I thought I can finance it with ads but so far the profit is 22.85 TRY(roughly 3.5 EUR). Therefore I want to get rid of them to avoid distractions.  I need support in order to continue my activities such as following the news, updating the website, making the translations and maintaining the technical aspect of the website.   For all the questions and advices you can directly contact me via 2019koronavirusu@gmail.com  Kind regards, Orkun",

    "description": "I can see that the situation with the coronavirus is getting very serious now, and I feel a quarantine will be in effect quite soon-so I had the idea to come on here to ask for some assistance to prepare for it. I already have a supply of masks and food and other basic supplies. However I want to get ahead on my rent and get more food and supplies, as I don't think I have nearly enough. I also use pre-payment energy meters so I want to get them topped-up as much as possible as well.\u00a0  I feel a little bit like David against a Goliath at the moment, this situation is more serious than most people seem to realise and times running out to get ahead of the curve. I'm a temp worker and suddenly jobs have all started to switch to 'cleaning' which is the last thing I want to do right now considering the virulence of this covid19. Clearly I hear a storms coming and I have prepared, but I'm not where I need to be. Your donation will make sure I can get through the next couple of months intact.  Thank You.",

    "description": " This is a fundraising initiative to pursue the creation of\u00a0a COVID-19 Vaccine by Dr. Wilfred Jefferies and his team.\u00a0   Dr. Wilfred Jefferies is a Professor in the Michael Smith Laboratories and a Senior Research Scientist in the Vancouver Prostate Centre at the University of British Columbia. Dr. Jefferies is working towards creating and testing a safe and effective vaccine for the novel coronavirus, COVID-19. His approach is explained here:    https://globalnews.ca/video/6622294/ubc-research-teams-work-on-high-performance-covid-19-vaccine    In January 2020, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified as the cause of an outbreak of pneumonia originating in Wuhan, China and has since spread to at least 89 countries and territories around the world.\u00a0Small-molecule anti-viral \u00a0therapies targeting different stages of the corona virus lifecycle may be\u00a0effective in treating COVID-19, however, in the absence of an effective vaccine, the probability of containment is low and the world must be\u00a0prepared for a pandemic. Therefore, the rapid\u00a0development of protective vaccines against COVID-19 has become a societal priority but remains a scientific challenge. The ideal COVID-19 vaccine would elicit highly potent neutralizing antibody responses against a broad spectrum of emerging COVID-19 viral strains; induce protection against infection and transmission; and be safe by not inducing any harmful immune or inflammatory responses. These are particular challenges in vaccination against viruses such as COVID-19. This funding initiative builds upon groundbreaking research by Dr. Jefferies and his team on vaccines against Rubella, West Nile Virus, Smallpox, Influenza, and Cancers and seeks to create and test a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine for rapid implementation.\u00a0  The Sullivan Urology Foundation supports Dr Jefferies in his work at UBC and the Vancouver Prostate Centre and is partnering with this GoFundMe in support of the development of a COVID-19 vaccine.\u00a0 The Sullivan Urology Foundation provides financial support to the Department of Urologic Sciences at the University of British Columbia for basic scientific translational and clinical research.\u00a0   http://www.urologyfoundation.ca/",

    "description": "  The supply of hand sanitiser at this point is scarce, due to the high demand of this product. I have prepared a homemade sanitiser for individual household used. To stop the propagation of the virus hand washing is the most effective way. Beside medical personnel, anyone in contact with the general public it is likely to become a carrier by spreading the virus through their hands. There are some hidden group of people who handle other people and their belongings all day long, for them to wash their hands as required is not possible. For them hand sanitiser is the answer, E.I. shop assistance, working with the elderly / kids, etc  A medical centre has gone through 50 standard dispensers in a week, I have ready the labour (volunteers), the tools and location to produce hand sanitiser that it will be distributed freely to schools, nursing homes, childcares, local shop assistance and any other people in need. I do this mainly to stop the propagation of the virus not to become a pandemic, I hope other people will come on board or follow this sample to be able to made enough to cover the whole region to keep the virus controlled. I truly believe that as individuals living in a society, we need to do our best to help our society when needs its individuals.  I already have $1000 but need another $10,000, so I can make a minimum purchase of ingredients from a bulk distributor, this will allow to prepare around 550 litres of hand sanitiser that will be equal to 11000 standard dispensers (50ml each). I just need contributions to buy the ingredients. As soon as I have the fund, I will be able to start the distribution of hand sanitiser within 3 days",

    "description": "As we face the COVID-19 pandemic in the US and worldwide, we all are wondering how we will get through it, individually and collectively. And people with chronic illnesses need specific strategies.  I'll get to the point:   I'm working with organizations and people across the country to help launch a powerful national network of people with chronic illnesses.    --  We need your support, your wisdom, and your love -- and if possible, financial contributions.  --      What We're Doing:  For now, we're calling it Chronic Illness Leadership For Emergent Times (CILFET). But what's most important is what we have done and will do  --  We hosted a video meeting on Saturday, March 7 that's now a  Healing Justice Podcast episode   ---  Thanks to: PeoplesHub, AIDS United, BEAM (Black Emotional and Mental Health Collective) Counter Narrative Project, Health Justice Commons, #MEAction Network, Positive Women's Network - USA and The Reunion Project  And to our webinar speakers, facilitators, promoters, strategists and producers Kate Werning of Healing Justice Podcast, Evvie Ormon of EmergingPhoenix consulting, Dr. Crissaris Sarnelli, Elandria Williams of PeoplesHub, Emily Szklarski, Joan Dark, Kate Sorensen, Andrew Reynolds,\u00a0 and Daisy Becerra.  --  We have materials from the webinar and resources up at  bit.ly/cilfetstuff.\u00a0   --  We will continue hosting and supporting mutual aid and conversations centering people with chronic illnesses and disabilities  --  We're planning and initiating a rapidly-scalable plan for this network based on emergent strategies and mutual aid. We need your support to move forward as quickly and effectively as possible.  Why We are Doing This:  As you know, people living with some chronic illnesses and disabilities are at greater risk of acquiring a coronavirus, having a more severe course of it and complications during or afterwards, and higher mortality rates.  And those facing oppression, marginalization and criminalization are most affected by heightened demands on health care systems and supply chains, economic turmoil, and rising stigma and bias.  (let\u2019s all take a breath or a little pause\u2026)  But queer and trans people have always had to find new paths for our survival. Our strategies for dealing with chronic illnesses, like our communities themselves, are diverse, creative and take nothing for granted.  We are building a small but amazing team of network strategists, health professionals and healers, facilitators, fiscal managers, disaster response pros, project managers and tech experts, communicators and media producers. We want to situate this vital network in a stable home or formation so it can do what it needs to do.  Your support goes directly to help this team do what we need to do -- which are primarily queer and trans people living with multiple chronic conditions.  Thank you.   GoFundMe has asked for people raising funds about COVID-19 to provide this specific information:    1. Who you are: JD Davids    2. Where you're from: I live in Brooklyn, NY    3. Your relationship to the parties you're raising funds for: They are for myself and a small team working on this effort. (see next question).    4. How the funds will be spent (be specific as possible): The funds will be used to donate to the small team of people who I am working with who are giving up time on other paid work or who are working with low pay to launch this important network. It includes me, and a social media and communications manager who lives in New Jersey, an artist and filmmaker in Utah, a recent graduate school graduate in New Orleans with a degree in disaster response, an organizer in Brooklyn who also works part time at a radical bookstore, and will include one of two people in NYC I am talking to who are experts in creating networks and sustainable cooperative groups.",

Currently, the government is mass quarantining people who have been infected in poor conditions and in places that were not designed to house large amounts of people for long periods of times (i.e sports stadiums, exhibits, etc). There is a growing shortage of basic medical supplies such as masks and medical kits for proper diagnoses\u2014this is expected to only be exacerbated with the continued lock down and eventually include food, water, etc. In most parts of China there is a significant shortage of masks and other protective wear, making the prevention and protection of civilians increasingly challenging.   We can not afford to allow basic protection/resources be the reason this mass spreads, kills more on a global scale and further impact the global economy.\u00a0 In 2003, SARS cost the global economy\u00a0 $40B.\u00a0 At that time, China's GDP was\u00a0 25% \u00a0of what it is today.\u00a0  Did you know?  Masks should be changed out every four hours in order to prevent virus from contaminating/penetrating the mask.   \n\nDue to shortages of medical kits the numbers are currently very underreported (31k diagnosed, 600+ deaths as of 2/6) and hospitals are forced to turn people away due to these shortages and hospital overcrowding.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know me, my name is Alice and I am from the greater Philadelphia area. I currently reside in San Francisco. 100% of the money raised will go towards the procuring and shipping supplies from the US to less urban areas of China where they are most challenged with basic resources to keep themselves safe.  My mom is currently in a small town (Jiangxi province) and has a group of volunteers that are willing to travel to neighboring towns to deliver and donate masks and other supplies to local hospitals.   This plan is set to evolve depending on how much we are able to raise. The more ambitious goal is to air ship supplies directly there (multiple times). Cost estimates and potential impact below (based on amazon prices--will also be researching wholesalers to improve quantities):  - $8,000  can buy ~ 2,200   N95 masks  that can be distributed to hospitals and quarantine facilities (to be used to protect nurses and doctors) - $8,000  can buy  40,000 flu masks  that will be distributed for civilian protection - $30,000  can buy  7,200 8 oz.  hand sanitizers -air ship cost: TBD. Placeholder for $5k for now.  Anything helps!! Thank you in advance!!\n\nUpdate Feb 13th: purchased and shipped 10 boxes of N95 masks via amazon ($1450)\n\nUpdate March 6th: first two boxes have arrived!!\n\nUpcoming plans: sending hand sanitizers to Wuhan directly to my cousins address for donations to local hospitals and schools.",

About two months ago he was diagnosed with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome if you don\u2019t know what that is, it\u2019s is a serious health problem that occurs when the body's defense (immune) system mistakenly attacks part of the peripheral nervous system. This leads to nerve inflammation that causes muscle weakness or paralysis and other symptoms. That day I cried my eyes out and my whole world turned upside down. But when I looked at Liam he had the greatest joy and giggled when I said peek a boo, your my little sunshine. It breaks my heart knowing that one day my baby boy could die. But he is stronger than anything in the whole wide world and he has a heart\nOf gold. For the past two months I have been going to specialists and surgeons and doctors appoints to get some info on how it gets better and about two\nDays ago Dr. Leung contacted me and said there is an experimental treatment but because he is so young it will cost a lot of money and me and my wife Lauren can\u2019t handle the cost. The surgery is Spinal tap (lumbar puncture). A small amount of fluid is withdrawn from the spinal canal in your lower back. The fluid is tested for a type of change that commonly occurs in people who have Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. That alone cost us $18,000. But that\u2019s not the problem the treatment is Immunoglobulin therapy. Immunoglobulin containing healthy antibodies from blood donors is given through a vein (intravenously). High doses of immunoglobulin can block the damaging antibodies that may contribute to Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. And cause it to dissipate to the point where he is clean and healthy and it cost us around $73,450. This treatment could allow me to be able to teach my son Liam how to play baseball \u26be\ufe0f and I would truly love that just as much as he would love to go to the park and enjoy life.

Help to prevent the spread of COVID-19 (Corona virus) by providing microphone windscreens to musicians hence protecting them from the saliva and grems transferred through microphones being used multiple times every hour during this week.\u00a0 We all continue providing windscreens free of charge after this festival has left our town as well.

The Kulen Elephant Forest opened its doors to the public on the 16th of December 2019.  By shifting the focus of animal-based tourism to conservation and retiring the world\u2019s most famous riding elephants, we take great pride in having been able to make such a statement. They are now in a safe haven, living a beautiful life at the Kulen Elephant Forest.   \u00a0But we are more than a safe home for the Elephants, we are an opportunity for the community; to improve education, conserve the natural world and bring everyone together in trying to preserve the remaining elephants of Cambodia.  Today, this vision is under threat. The outbreak of the CoViD-19 has negatively impacted Cambodia\u2019s tourism in such a way that we are now fearful. Fearful that we now may struggle to sustain ourselves alone. Our self-sustaining model relied on tourism to finance our basic operations, and being so new, we did not have the time to save enough for this kind of contingency.  \u00a0We need YOUR HELP to care for them.   Especially our oldest elephants who need more food, supplements and medical supplies.  \u00a0 $1000 = cost to care for 1 elephant per month  $20 = daily food cost for 1 elephant  $10 = daily medical cost for 1 elephant.

    "description": "\n Not so long ago I didn't really think about what was going on in China with the coronavirus. How many people are sick with it. I thought the media was just panicking.\n \n\n But 2 days ago my friend Mike got the coronavirus in Italy. He was there on vacation with his family, now doctors forbid even to visit him.  After that, I wondered what I could do to help fight the virus. What can we do?\n \n\n But we can do a lot!  COVID-19 is a fairly strong virus with high persistence, which increases in hematologic progression. The only thing that mankind can do at the moment is to have a vaccine that will take 5 years or more to develop (along with trials).   Now mankind can only prevent it from spreading so fast. To do so, you need to reduce contact with humans and wear masks.   At the moment, people in Europe are in great need of masks. As in Korea, especially China. But Europe was not ready for such a rapid spread of the virus, so they now have an acute shortage of masks.  That's why we want to help with our own means as well as to attract donors to buy/create N95 masks and send them to Europe. To countries such as Italy, France, Germany, and others.\n \n\n In this environment, many speculators have appeared. Which inflates the prices of masks ten times. Not everyone can afford these masks.  But we plan to send more than MILLIONS of masks.   Every cent is important to us.  Stop the virus spreading together!",

Killin it with Kindness: Giving and Undertaking a scary and endless task \u00a0for those in need! And right now in our home state there is MASSIVE NEED!\n\nWe live in the epicenter of the Coronavirus epidemic for the USA, Bellevue Washington.\u00a0 Just a few miles from Kirkland, Washington, where virtually all our states deaths have ensued. We are in respectable physical health and BELIEVE our immune systems are resilient. We are saddened to see so many people terrified and so few that are willing to help; do to fear and rightly so. We feel the need to do what is on our hearts and volunteer to suit up and go to Battle with this Epidemic. \u00a0To start, we want to offer our services to completely disinfect areas around King, Pierce, Snohomish County, and surrounding areas. \u00a0No job too small or big, we would firstly like to focus on places centered on those with already compromised immune systems, people who have self-quarantined and need some extra help to disinfect their location\u00a0 Communal gathering Places, Schools, and Churches. Stores and restaurants \n\n\n\nWe ask YOU to please consider a donation of even 5$ to support attainment the costly supplies needed to do this job!! These things include (but are not limited to):\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Powerful germ killing Steam Cleaners that can range from $300-$2000\n\nHot water power washers,\n\nIndustrial disinfectant, sanitization kits\n\nSanitization suits, a piece of personal protective equipment that consists of an impermeable whole-body garment worn as protection against hazardous materials.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nGLOVES\n\nRespirator with inserts for bio/ chemical filtration\n\nSoap and antibacterial BODY WASH\n\nVitamins and supplements to keep our healthy team that way!!\n\nLiving in the epicenter of this virus right now is seriously eerie, when the streets of Seattle are bare and the roads are clear. People are held hostage in their own homes under this virus and its still spreading , we vow to fight this TILL THE END. We are asking for a goal of $15,000 to allow us to purchase these needed tools ASAP and get to Work!!\n\nAs long as the donations allow it we will be working nonstop going to the front lines with our weapons of mass destruction until the coronavirus has left the building! Services will be complimentary for those who cannot afford it. Period. LET\u2019S DO THIS.\n\nWho are we? Just a small group of Janitorial Workers, and Property Maintenance and management personnel who are healthy and not crippled by fear, who are willing to do the job that very few are willing to do, we will update regularly on what our team is doing to help slow and stop this virus from spreading any further.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you and God bless, if you cannot donate please share!",

It's been a month already but seems to prolong for more time since the chaos is only getting worse. Well.. my brother is a teacher and my parents own a small afterschool business in Korea as their only income source. Now they have no income out of no where with no warning, they have no money to survive.. No money to buy groceries or masks which are only getting more and more expensive, and their bills are hitting them left and right stacking up like crazy... It pains me to see them reusing disposable surgical masks which wouldn't do anything to protect them.. As I am the only one who live in the states, I've been sending them as much money as I can but it's far from enough since I only make so much as I'm new to the career.\u00a0 We weren't prepared for this.. This Coronavirus hit them with no warning.. Nobody saw this coming.. Can you imagine the whole family having no income or job out of no where especially during a disaster like this? It's so scary... I haven't seen my family for 3 years and was planning on finally visiting them on May... I miss them so much but now that's my least concern. All I can think about all day is my family's survival back home... Please help them.. even if it's not much, every penny counts and your help will be very much appreciated regardless the amount. And most importantly, please pray for them... every single prayer counts.. God bless you.",

    "description": "Unfortunately its all come down to this. After a 10 day trip visiting my family in Florida I had what appeared to be a panic attack on January 27th on my way back home across the country to Arizona. A shortness of breath came over me,my blood pressure rose, and my heart started palpitating like crazy. Needless to say I thought I was having a heart attack and was going to die.  \u00a0 \u00a0 I had a connecting flight in Dallas but sent my luggage through to Arizona and got taken to the hospital. They did loads of blood tests, nasal swab, the works. Everything came back normal and they sent me on my way.  \u00a0 \u00a0The next day I woke up with a really dry mouth and a fever in the hotel, that tightness in my chest was still there and I felt as though I couldn't breathe but this time I was alone. \u00a0 \u00a0This is all in the midst of the Coronavirus scare so I was somewhat worried especially since I was in the same hospital as the Texas first case. Before many Americans were taking it seriously. I had a choice to make; go home thousands of miles from my family or get my flight changed and get to the bottom of this.  \u00a0 \u00a0 Fast forward to now. I've been to the E.R. 4 times and saw my primary care for the first time last week. I had another fever and dry mouth and a dry cough for the first time. They tested me for the flu and it came back negative. \u00a0 \u00a0Now everyday my breathing has been getting worse. Then I find out that COVID-19 has shown up in Florida cities away from eachother with no travel history of patients. I've attempted to get tested for COVID-19 but it all failed despite being at three seperate international airports and Florida hotspots before travel restrictions were implemented. Somehow I still dont fit the testing criteria.  \u00a0 \u00a0Now I'm with my family who is trying to be cool and collected but I feel I'm just a burden. I have no income and one weeks woth of clothes. Whats worse is I'm seeing them getting sick as well and they're trying to ignore it. I'm now stuck with medical bills and dont think I'll be able to make it and pay them. I lost my job over this illness and just want to be able to keep my family comfortable if I die.  \u00a0 As much as I hate sob stories and begging for money I ask you fine folk to please get the word about this out there. I would hate for my community to fall victim to such a terrifying disease. I'll keep updates via youtube most likely. If anyone has any medical supplies they would be willing to spare that would also be appreciated. \u00a0 \u00a0 If I'm able to get tested for COVID-19 before this gets any worse I'll update you. If I find out what's actually happening I'll update you. If I get quarantined I'll update you. I just want to keep my loved ones safe. As should all of you. \u00a0 \u00a0 Any advice on where to support COVID-19 patients would be very helpful as well because I would like to put 20% of donations toward families affected by COVID-19. As a hurricane Katrina survivor I understand what its like to be in an idle position where you feel hopeless and helpless. I dont want my loved ones to be in that position ever again.

It hasn't got the noise and limitations that other contemporary live streaming\u00a0apps have. \n\nIt's literally a Students App for Learning, Tutoring   Sharing!\n\nThe App would focus on making it easier for pupils studying/learning together in a more interactive environment from the comfort of their home.\u00a0\n\nThe design, of which we have wireframe sketches, is specific for the needs of those Learning/Studying in a highly interactive way that no mobile app platform currently offer.\n\nThe app will be FREE!\n\nLearners can study together and be tutored in a much more dedicated and interactive environment, using all the unique features that will compliment this mobile application.\n\nInitially I would like to develop this mobile application for the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire county as my daughter's network spread across these 2 counties.\n\nHowever, should this prove beneficial through popularity and testimonials that link to improved tests and exam results, there is scope and a projected plan for scaling this to more counties, nationally and even across Europe.\u00a0\n\nWith your help I can solve my daughter and her peers' current problem and potentially help even more young pupils and tutors from the wider regions which could include your child or other relatives.\n\nWe can do this!",

    "description": "A new coronavirus named COVID-19 has spread across multiple continents and infected thousands of people. The virus has caused more than 3,000 deaths, primarily in China. Donations to this fund will help stop the spread of COVID-19 and support response efforts. (Please note: We cannot accept donations originating from Mainland China in accordance with the Law of the People's Republic of China on Administration of Activities of Overseas Nongovernmental Organizations.  Challenge    It is critical to stop the spread of the virus and provide medical care to those who need it. Patients and front-line medical responders in high-risk and quarantined areas need supplies and continued support as the crisis unfolds. \u00a0  Solution    Donations to this fund will bring services to affected communities and help stop the virus's spread. Initially, the fund will help meet immediate needs for healthcare, food, and water in partnership with our nonprofit partners. As the situation unfolds, it will transition to support longer-term education and recovery efforts run by local, vetted organizations in affected regions. We will work with our partners on the ground to allocate funds where they're most needed. \u00a0  Long-Term Impact    We believe that organizations that are deeply rooted in local communities are in the best position to provide long-term support for survivors of outbreaks and other crises. By funding the relief efforts of local organizations, donations to this fund have the potential to build stronger response capacity so that these organizations are better equipped to face future outbreaks. gofundme will post reports about how funds have been used and will email these reports to donors .",

This will have the health benefits of containing and reducing the spread of the virus. In reality for people, there are still bills to be paid.  For some, employers will be providing Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) from day 1.  For others , no such pay will be available.  There are parents that would need to take time off if their child's school closes. Those that are self employed will also not have the benefit of an employer paying SSP.  Yes there are options of benefits that can be claimed, however this is not always a quick and straightforward task.  This fundraiser is a to be a relief to those that really need it should the situation arise.  I have set up a dedicated email address; which will be updated on here if the funding is successful.\u00a0  As with all support, there will need to be a request for help and appropriate vetting to prevent abuse.  Thank you for taking the time, and hopefully we can help those that will be in need.",

    "description": "I'm interested in playing in The 2020 WSOP (World Series of Poker).\u00a0 It's a 7 week long series of Bracelet Events that offers various buy-ins to tournaments (from $500 for the May 28th beginning of The Big 50 Event....to $10,000 for The Main Event that opens in early July).\u00a0\u00a0  I came up with the $55,000 goal...because it would allow me to enter a number of $500-$5,000 no-limit hold'em events without fearing the pressure to play well/run well in any one particular event (anyone who plays poker successfully, knows that variance in any one event is generally random). In addition, I'd love an opportunity to play in the $10,000 Main Event (which usually offers approximately $8 million in 1st place winnings, with $1 million for those who make the 9 handed final table).\u00a0\u00a0  Also, a $55,000 Bankroll ($50k for tournament buy-ins...$5k for expenses during the 7 weeks playing tournaments) would allow me enough expense money to get me through the 7 week WSOP summer.\u00a0 I'd be staying at The Budget Suites (kitchenettes run around $300 a week, I'd be driving my own vehicle to Las Vegas, and of course food would be included in this.\u00a0 I've never been a big party guy..in other words, I'd be down there for poker...not to experience the 'what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas).  In return for raising this $55,000...I'd be willing to give 50% of my winnings to charity (why?\u00a0 Because without the ability to raise this money, I would not have an opportunity to play a number of these events.\u00a0 If The Corona Virus becomes much more serious in America, I'd like to devote a significant portion of the 50% of my winnings to Corona Victims, particularly senior citizen victims who are the most vulnerable to The Corona Virus.\u00a0  While I'm far from being one of the best poker players in the world, one is able to google my name (just type in Paul Lentz Poker..and you'll see that I do have some decent results over the years playing.\u00a0 In other words, I have\u00a0 it in me to make a few deep runs if the cards run right).\u00a0  If I'm able to raise the money to play in Vegas, I'll post my progress throughout the day on Facebook.\u00a0 Each tournament offers chip count updates regularly for each tournament on The WSOP website.\u00a0\u00a0  I'd be happy to discuss this much more in depth...if I'm able to raise this money.\u00a0 It's always been a dream of mine to have a bankroll like this just for The WSOP...as well as an opportunity to do some good with my winnings IF I'm able to run/play well this summer!  Thank any/all of you for your potential support!",

    "description": "\n  Help us fight the CoronaVirus by donating! \n \n\n  What is Covid-19 \u2013 the illness that started in Wuhan?  It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.   What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?  The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.   Is the virus being transmitted from one person to another?  China\u2019s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.   How many people have been affected?  As of 6 March, the global death toll was 3,404, while more than 100,000 people have been infected in more than 80 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.  The death toll has passed 3,000 in China, where there have been over 80,000 cases. South Korea, the nation worst hit by the outbreak outside China, has had 6,593 cases. More than 55,000 people in China have recovered from Covid-19.   Why is this worse than normal influenza, and how worried are the experts?  We don\u2019t yet know how dangerous the new coronavirus is, and we won\u2019t know until more data comes in. The mortality rate is around 2% in the epicentre of the outbreak, Hubei province, and less than that elsewhere. For comparison, seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1% and is thought to cause about 400,000 deathseach year globally. Sars had a death rate of more than 10%.  Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population \u2013 elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems \u2013 to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.\n \n\n  Why we want to help?  As you may be aware, people\u00a0all across the globe are flocking to grocery stores and wholesale clubs as the number of coronavirus cases continues to grow. Those of us who are fortunate enough to be able to go and buy in bulk,\u00a0everything we need, such as; masks, gloves, canned foods, hand sanitizer etc. are fine, but as this continues, the price gouging continues as does the major retail stores facing short to long term shortages. We want to help those who are not fortunate enough to able to take these basic cautionary steps, whether the reason is they are elderly, homeless, simply can not afford it or have mobility issues.\n \n\n  What we want to do to help fight the virus?  Our main focus is to keep supplying what is needed in order for all of us as a community to fight this. This is why we will be using the money you generously donate, to lease a factory warehouse, purchase the machines and equipment necessary to manufacture N95 Respiratory masks, gloves, overall protective wear, hand sanitizers as well as be able to source and stock on canned foods and the essentials we all need to protect ourselves and stay healthy.  Thank you for taking your time to read through and we hope you donate to help us!  Please contact us for any questions you may have!",

    "description": "The coronavirus disease started in December 2019. It was first identified in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in China. The study so far shows that it originated from another animal and subsequently spread between people. Symptoms may include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Up to now, there is no vaccine or specific treatment. Patients are treated with symptoms management and supportive therapy.   Up to Feb 21, 2020, over 75,000 people were diagnosed as patients of coronavirus disease. 2236 people died. Since the first week of the outbreak, the medical supplies have been in shortage. None of the hospitals had enough reserves of medical materials. A lot of medical workers and volunteers were almost unprotected.     As young adults, we want to do something for them. Before this benefit concert, we raised around $12,000 and connected with a hospital in Huanggang. The good news is that the supplies we purchased departed on Feb 21 from Chicago to China. And Huanggang Central Hospital will receive them within a few days.\u00a0    Please click the link below   for more info of Benefit Concert for Coronavirus Relief at Bard College:   https://www.facebook.com/ziyue.he.9828/posts/101526228115263?__tn__=K-R      Speech from President Leon Botstein at the beginning   With the generous support of Bard College and Bard College Conservatory of Music, we organized a benefit concert within ten days and the result was so inspiring and optimistic that went beyond our expectation.

Every day we get more patients fighting Coronavirus but our resources are finished. I am not talking about face masks or hand gel. I am talking about oxygen, and breathing machines for pneumonia, and antiviral treatments.\u00a0 \n[...] \nThis means every day me and my colleagues have to choose. We choose who gets treatment, and who just has to go home and wait. Like in wartime.\"\n\nThis is part of a message shared by a friend at the forefront of the current outbreak in Lombardy, Italy.\u00a0 \n\nI am from a small town close to Brescia, but I live in the UK. My whole family still lives there.\nI woke up last Sunday to the news that the whole region was quarantined. Nobody in, nobody out.\nA couple of phone calls were enough for me to understand the severity of the situation, and to feel the urge to help, which is why I created this page.\n\nOver 5000 people tested positive to COVID-19 in the past two weeks in Italy, including 10% of the health professionals who are working to contain the emergency.\u00a0 \n\nIn the most affected northern area, 95% of the total intensive care beds are taken. \n\nMore beds, more medical equipment, more medications are necessary to end this. The sooner this ends in Italy, China, and all worst-hit regions, the smaller the chance the virus reaches your Country, your City, and your family. \n\nPlease help with whatever you can today. \n\nAll donations will go to Azienda Ospedaliera Spedali Civili di Brescia, and will be used to purchase equipment and medications to treat COVID-19.

As you are already aware of, the whole world has been concerned about the newly rise yet dangerous virus called coronavirus (Covid-19), which creates lung problems. Originated in Wuhan, China, the virus has spread throughout every continent, infecting more than 75000 people with 2009 killed as of February 19, 2020. The World Health Organization has declared the virus \u201ca global threat.\u201d And we need to help those in need of basic medical supplies to prevent the spread of the virus. I want to address this issue to my home country, Mongolia, which no cases declared so far. Here, although many people are aware of the disease and try to take precautions, there are some \u2013 especially THE POOR - who do not have the fair chance to access the most basic safety. Because of the virus, the cost of face masks has risen dramatically; worse still, they are out of stock in many areas due to different reasons. The situation creates a huge disadvantage for the needy. I am organizing this fund to buy masks from the overseas and give them to the people in poor areas in Mongolia which are currently facing a huge shortage of masks. My goal is to get $10,000 for this fund; and we need to act quickly since the price of masks is changing constantly due to the shortage. The money will then be sent to a doctor that I have contact with to buy masks; then the masks will be sent back to some friends of mine in Mongolia who will help me distribute them to poor people. Thank you for your consideration. Every penny counts!",

In questo periodo \u00e8 molto importante limitare la vita sociale, per frenare la diffusione del virus e tornare al pi\u00f9 presto alla normalit\u00e0.  Queste precauzioni necessarie hanno purtroppo enormi conseguenze sull'economia locale.   Aiutiamo Firenze a rialzarsi con un \"  caff\u00e8  \u00a0virtuale\"!   Anche se non possiamo frequentare fisicamente negozi e locali pubblici con la frequenza di prima, facciamo ugualmente arrivare il nostro sostegno ai commercianti fiorentini!     Doniamo \u00a0l'equivalente di un  caff\u00e8 , di un  aperitivo , di una  cena , di un  acquisto in un negozio , di tutte quelle cose che avremmo fatto pi\u00f9 volte e che anche adesso faremmo volentieri, ma che in questo momento \u00e8 prudente ed opportuno limitare.  L'invito a fare sentire la nostra vicinanza e collaborazione responsabile \u00e8 rivolto a tutti quelli che vivono o lavorano a Firenze, o che semplicemente vogliono contribuire a sostenere la citt\u00e0 in questo momento.  Non ci sono limiti alla somma che \u00e8 possibile raccogliere.  Le donazioni saranno fatte pervenire al sindaco Dario Nardella, affinch\u00e9 si occupi di farle distribuire nel modo pi\u00f9 opportuno agli esercizi pubblici di Firenze.\u00a0        ----------------------------------------------------  Se volete, aiutateci a diffondere questa campagna sui social, magari usando gli hashtag #caff\u00e8virtualiFirenze e #coronavirusitalia. ----------------------------------------------------  Sarebbe fantastico se poteste aprire  campagne simili per un altro Comune che volete sostenere , sempre usando il titolo \"Caff\u00e8 virtuali contro il Coronavirus: (nome del Comune)\".  Prima di aprire una nuova campagna, controllate se qualcuno lo ha gi\u00e0 fatto. \u00a0Per evitare dispersioni eccessive, \u00e8 sensato aprire una campagna per Comune, non per piccoli centri o singoli esercizi.

    "description": "Due to the current Coronavirus outbreak or pandemic, it is better to provide prevention of sick people exposing themselves to the general public.  A friend of mine had told me about a thermal imaging device that captures pictures of that person and gantry control with A.I. which was invented by a Chinese company during this crisis. They are working around the clock to provide to the Chinese government and companies.  It can detect heat signatures over 37 degrees and gives a warning. It can also be incorporated into gantry and autogate systems. Putting up these devices at the entrance of shopping malls, supermarkets, churches can help to detect those people with fever (common symptoms of Coronavirus, SARS, MERS, etc.). Then a security officer can advise the sick to go home and rest.  Places and areas like (trains, buses, restaurants, malls, cinemas, stadiums, etc.) are common spread of viruses to the mass public. So prevention is always better than cure.  Currently, these devices are only in the Chinese language and I have requested them to do an English version. They are too busy to just produce an English unit and send it as a sample. They will provide an update tool (APP) so that I can do changes myself if I make a purchase. The cost of one unit is AUD$4000. So I hoping that through gofundme, I can get these funds to do my first purchase then make the language update and then send out this sample to respective businesses and government agencies for them to test and get them to start helping the general public with better detection.",

In an effort to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, regional officials canceled the public celebration of Mass throughout much of northern Italy, and upended sacred rituals of Italian life.  Soccer players have held matches in\u00a0empty stadiums. Milan\u2019s vibrant\u00a0aperitivo scene has slowed\u00a0to a halt, and empty trams smell of disinfectant. Ms. Kranzelmayer\u2019s employer, like many in Lombardy, has ordered its staff to work from home, and her children cannot return to school for at least another week. The\u00a0coronavirus has infected\u00a0more than 1,500 people in Italy, with nearly 1,000 of the cases in the Lombardy region in the north, which includes Milan. At least 34 people, almost all elderly or with underlying conditions, have died.

    "description": "Sono un medico italiano, vivo a Londra e parlo ogni giorno, ormai da settimane, della questione coronavirus con i miei amici pugliesi disperati per ci\u00f2 che sta accadendo in Italia. L'idea che la nostra terra venga messa in ginocchio da un virus che, ad oggi, non sappiamo come sconfiggere, non ci d\u00e0 pace e sentiamo il bisogno di fare qualcosa per aiutare il nostro sistema sanitario e quindi noi stessi.  Leggiamo in questi giorni che gli ospedali  nel sud Italia  non hanno i fondi per affrontare le spese legate a questa imprevista emergenza sanitaria.  Quando i numeri di contagio aumenteranno, i  nostri\u00a0ospedali  non avranno posti letto per tutti, non ci saranno\u00a0 ventilatori polmonari per tutti i pazienti critici.\u00a0 Presto anche i medici, cos\u00ec come sta succedendo nel nord Italia, risulteranno positivi al virus, cos\u00ec\u00a0 anche i medici, scarseggeranno.\u00a0 Il nostro SUD rischia di non farcela.  Non so quanto, con questo breve messaggio, riusciremo a smuovere lo scetticismo della gente che non crede nelle raccolte fondi, e a fare credere loro che se solo riuscissimo a riunire le forze potremmo fare la differenza.  Non siamo i Ferragnez, lo sappiamo, siamo solo in gruppo di amici e non sappiamo se questo tentativo riuscir\u00e0. Quello che sappiamo\u00a0\u00e8 che l'Italia \u00e8 un paese che non si arrende, che gli italiani sono in grado di sorprendere, e che siamo famosi nel mondo per tante ragioni ma la pi\u00f9 importante \u00e8 che abbiamo un cuore grande.\u00a0  Non permetteremo al coronavirus di prendersi i nostri cari, le nostre nonne, i nostri pap\u00e0. Non lo permetteremo perch\u00e9 insieme possiamo fare la differenza.  Questi soldi serviranno per rinforzare gli ospedali del sud per comprare ventilatori polmonari da donare negli ospedali che cureranno i nostri cari. Forza ragazzi!",

Sto vivendo la preoccupazione attraverso i suoi occhi e le sue parole. Passa la maggior parte della sua vita in ospedale, sono due settimane che non lo posso abbracciare e dorme in un\u2019altra stanza della casa per tutelare la nostra salute.\u00a0  E come lui, \u00a0tutti i medici e gli infermieri lavorano in silenzio, senza sosta, senza riflettori, impegnati a dare il loro contributo per bloccare questo virus che non guarda in faccia nessuno.

    "description": "The World is under attack from an unseen enemy, called the Coronavirus, also known as the COVID-19 virus. It is no longer a question of \u201cif\u201d but \u201cwhen\u201d Americans will be faced with decisions about whether to work, or self quarantine because they are not feeling well and may have the virus. Many Americans work paycheck to paycheck and missing a minimum 14 days work in order not to spread this virus can have a devastating effect of their everyday lives, not to mention the further spread of this potentially life threatening virus out of desperation.  It is our Mission to help those who have acted responsible under this situation to make the correct choice and self quarantine without fear of falling so far behind that you could end up homeless.\u00a0Nearly half of\u00a0Americans live paycheck to paycheck: Bank survey. A near majority of\u00a0Americans, 49%, are\u00a0living paycheck to paycheck, according to a new survey by the First National Bank of Omaha. The survey also found that 53% of respondents do not have an emergency fund that covers at least three months of expenses. Are goal is to bring assistance to poor and distressed households that will be effected by this outbreak. By Americans getting involved in this effort we can lesson the burdens of the government.  \u00a0We will help all qualified applicants to pay 80% their bills, which will include Rent, or mortgage payments, utilities and bills related medicines to treat this virus.  \u00a0By assisting those who cannot afford to simply stay home, which is the low income sectors, like service industry related jobs, manufacturing and construction fields of the American population, we hope to do our part in the containment of this devastating pandemic that has reached our shores.  \u00a0It is not simply the responsibility of our government on the local to National levels to work to protect us it is Our responsibility to help ourselves and our Country. If you were suddenly hit with a $500 unexpected bill, would you be able to cover it?  If the answer is no, you're not alone.  \u00a0Nearly six in 10 Americans don't have enough savings to cover a $500 or $1,000 unplanned expense, according to a new report from Bankrate.  \u00a0Only 41% of adults reported having enough in their savings account to cover a surprise bill of this magnitude. A little more than 20% said they would put it on a credit card, the report said, while 20% would cut their spending and 11% would turn to friends and family for financial assistance.  This is an all hands on battle for our future, the future of our Nation, and\u00a0 possibly the future of humanity. Many people are going become sick, many of them if they have underlying health issues and are elderly may die.\u00a0 Join us, and together we can defeat this pandemic by helping those who are financially unable to help themselves in making the right decision to self-quarantine without fear. We can spend a few pennies today and be proactive or spend huge sums of money to try an catch up. There is no doubt that containment seems to be the key.",

Puoi trovare ulteriori informazioni su di me su  https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreamodenini/   Inutile dire che il Coronavirus (COVID-19) sta diventando un'emergenza globale. A partire da ieri, la mia cara Parma \u00e8 entrata nella \"zona rossa\". I miei genitori, entrambi 60enni, lavorano in ospedale e direttamente con pazienti affetti da Coronavirus. Ero senza parole quando mio padre mi disse per telefono:   \"Andrea, in 35 anni di carriera, non ho mai visto una cosa del genere. Non \u00e8 una semplice influenza. Stiamo lavorando 12-14 ore al giorno, 7 giorni su 7. Spero che usciremo da questa emergenza. Stiamo esaurendo il personale, i letti per i pazienti, e quant'altro\".   e potete immaginare come ci si puo' sentire impotenti a 1000 km di distanza. Ed \u00e8 per questo che sono qui! Sto organizzando questa raccolta fondi per l'Ospedale di Parma appositamente per l'emergenza Coronavirus ( https://www.ao.pr.it/chi-siamo/beneficenza/ ).  Gestir\u00f2 tutti i documenti (in conformit\u00e0 con la legge), vi terr\u00f2 aggiornatoie ovviamente una volta che avro' raggiunto l'obiettivo, vi fornir\u00f2 tutta la documentazione della donazione.   Se potete per favore aiutami in questa raccolta, vi prego di donare e condividere con tutti i vostri contatti!   -------------------  ENGLISH  Hi all, \u00a0I'm Andrea, an Italian from Parma, living in Netherlands. You can find more about me on   https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreamodenini/    Needless to say that Coronavirus (COVID-19) is becoming a global emergency. Starting from yesterday, my home city Parma entered in the \"red zone\", meaning no entry nor exit. My parents, both 60 years old, work at the Hospital and they are working directly in the division for treating patients affected by Coronavirus. I was speechless when my father told me with his own words by telephone the following:  \" Andrea, in 35 years of career, I've never seen something like that.\u00a0 It's not just a simple flu. We're working 12-14 hours/day, 7/7. I hope we're gonna get out of this emergency. We're running out of personnel, beds for patients, etc. \"  and you can imagine feeling 1000 km away powerless.\u00a0 And that's why I'm here! I'm raising a funding for the Parma Hospital specifically for Coronavirus emergency (  https://www.ao.pr.it/chi-siamo/beneficenza/  ).  I will manage all the paperwork (in compliance to Italian law), keep you posted, and obviously once reached the target I will provide proof of the donation.    If you could please help me in this, please donate and share with all your contacts!",

Inutile sperare che la situazione qui non peggiori, soprattutto alla luce di tutti questi spostamenti incontrollati; sappiamo tutti che non siamo minimamente attrezzati e che la nostra regione ed in particolare la citt\u00e0 di Reggio Calabria sono le pi\u00f9 precarie. Abbiamo BISOGNO di fondi che ci consentano di potenziare la terapia intensiva e il reparto di malattie infettive, stavolta abbiamo la possibilit\u00e0 di PREVENIRE la situazione e di non arrivare impreparati, da questo nasce l\u2019idea di far partire gi\u00e0 da ora questa raccolta fondi: per portarci AVANTI col lavoro, e per giocare per una volta d\u2019ANTICIPO contro un nemico per il quale siamo disarmati!",

    "description": "  I FONDI RACCOLTI VERRANNO DONATI ALL'OSPEDALE SAN CARLO BORROMEO DI MILANO PER POTENZIARE IL REPARTO DI TERAPIA INTENSIVA E RIANIMAZIONE   Covid-19, noto confidenzialmente con il nome di Corona Virus.\u00a0  Questo \u00e8 il nome del nemico che in questi giorni sta sfidando non uno specifico paese, non una particolare etnia n\u00e8 un certo tipo di fascia sociale o culturale, bens\u00ec potenzialmente chiunque di noi.  Covid-19 non guarda in faccia a nessuno.\u00a0  Questa situazione \u00e8 senza precedenti in epoca moderna e sta avendo numerose ripercussioni a livello sociale ed economico. Tuttavia sta avendo anche un altro tipo di risvolto: sta portando alla luce nuovi aspetti delle persone, nel bene e nel male.  Nel male ha suscitato: psicosi di massa, supermercati saccheggiati, disinformazione, minimizzazione o negazione del problema, esodi sconsiderati di persone potenzialmente infette, paura, odio ed episodi di razzismo.  Nel bene tuttavia: ha portato le persone a documentarsi, il servizio sanitario, tanto spesso criticato con leggerezza, ha reagito in maniera estremamente efficace con i mezzi a disposizione, molte strutture sono state potenziate, ha sensibilizzato molte persone ad azioni di solidariet\u00e0 e di prevenzione, ha fatto prendere coscienza a molti di quanto i nostri operatori sanitari, forze dell'ordine e tanti altri si adoperino quotidianamente per la comunit\u00e0. E ci sono state anche tante altre reazioni positive a livello personale e sociale, l'elenco potrebbe essere lungo.  Tuttavia ancora non basta: l'emergenza esiste, ed \u00e8 di portata davvero straordinaria. Il nostro sistema sanitario non \u00e8 in grado di reggere la pressione che questa situazione sta portando n\u00e8 a livello di personale, n\u00e8 a livello di strutture (inteso come posti in rianimazione e terapia intensiva), n\u00e8 a livello di attrezzature.\u00a0  Sia chiaro: io sono uno qualsiasi, come tanti di voi che. Sono uno che ha sempre cercato di trasmettere agli altri dei messaggi positivi e, nel suo piccolo, di fare qualcosa di buono per gli altri.\u00a0 Sto vivendo questa situazione da vicino perch\u00e8 la mia compagna \u00e8 medico rianimatore, quindi sono sensibile a ci\u00f2 che vive lei, ma prima di tutto sono una persona che sta cercando di capire cosa sta succedendo. Sono uno che, come voi, sta vivendo questa epoca strana, in cui c'\u00e8 tanta confusione.  Forse \u00e8 una metafora un po' forte, ma possiamo dire che sono giorni in cui la Morte cammina per le strade, va al cinema, va nelle scuole, prende la metropolitana, va in ufficio... fa una vita qualsiasi, una vita come quella di tanti di noi.  E, percorrendo le nostre stesse strade, vivendo la nostra quotidianit\u00e0, pu\u00f2 incrociarci in qualsiasi momento e decidere di baciarci... un bacio freddo, che toglie il respiro. Ma non te ne accorgi subito e magari, nel frattempo, quel bacio tu lo dai alla tua compagna, ai tuoi genitori, ai tuoi figli...  Eppure ancora c'\u00e8 tanta disinformazione in merito, tanto menefreghismo, tanta superficialit\u00e0.  Oggi riflettevo sul fatto che se ognuno di noi diffondesse della buona informazione a chi gli sta intorno, si potrebbe riuscire ad arginare la diffusione del virus.\u00a0 Da qui il passo \u00e8 stato breve e mi sono chiesto: \"ma se ognuno di noi mettesse un nichelino, non si potrebbe aiutare il sistema sanitario con delle attrezzature o qualcosa in pi\u00f9?\" Nell'era dei social abbiamo la possibilit\u00e0 di avere la giusta diffusione e uno strumento magnifico come il crowdfunding per permettere a tutti di contribuire.  Cos\u00ec ho deciso di provarci, di fare il passo e fare qualcosa di concreto e permettere ad altri di aiutarmi, di aiutarci l'un l'altro  La somma che ho scelto non \u00e8 stata calcolata su budget o conti scientifici e, oggettivamente, non so quanto possa influire in una battaglia su questa scala.  Ma penso sia comunque un gesto importante, che pu\u00f2 permettere a tante persone di fare qualcosa, di agire. Ogni azione comporta un cambiamento, per quanto piccola. E' il cosiddetto \"effetto farfalla\".  Proviamoci... anche se possono sembrare gesti piccoli, facciamoli!  Dopo tutto, mettendo insieme delle gocce si pu\u00f2 formare una pozzanghera, ma anche un oceano!  Fatelo! Facciamolo!\u00a0  Per noi, per le persone a cui teniamo... e anche per tutti gli altri in fondo! Perch\u00e8, in qualche modo, tutta questa storia ci pu\u00f2 unire! E penso che questa sia la cosa pi\u00f9 fantastica che pu\u00f2 venire da tutta questa confusione. Il fatto di vincerla ed uscirne pi\u00f9 uniti di prima. Non come nazione, o come identit\u00e0 culturale, ma come PERSONE!  Io ci provo. Sono uno di voi. Aiutiamoci!  Grazie a tutti!

    "description": " Story   In December, our well pump died and we\u2019ve been without running water ever since. We're raising $1500 to replace the well and $500 to survive until we can get it replaced.   We\u2019ve been using bottled water, but it\u2019s expensive and hard to deal with. We\u2019re both disabled and this a big hardship for us.   [Image by  Willfried Wende  from  Pixabay ]  Now people have been buying out all the bottled water stock at our local stores in preparation for a COVID19 outbreak, and it will be much harder for us to source potable water.  The replacements we use in lieu of running water, like bathing wipes, dry shampoo, bottled drinks and disposable utensils, are not good for us, our finances, or the environment.    [Image by  Bilderjet  from  Pixabay ]  Please help us fix our well so we can go back to living more normal lives.   Thank you for your donations and for sharing our fundraiser! With your help we can get this done.   [Image by  Susanne Jutzeler, suju-foto \u00a0 from  Pixabay ]   Costs   We estimate that the well repair will be about $1500 including a new pump and labor. We\u2019ve included an extra $500 in the goal to help us buy the things we need in the meantime, which will be a lot of disposable utensils and ready made meals since we have no way to wash dishes.    Risks   It\u2019s possible that the repairs will be more expensive than my estimate, but that seems unlikely.   It's also possible that we won't raise enough money to replace the pump and we won't be able to make up the difference for a while.    Notes   Title Image by  Ron Porter  from  Pixabay .   I hope we can update the campaign with images from our own lives soon. I just wanted to get this live as soon as possible so that we can get water again.",

    "description": "\n  Il Corona Virus avanza e gli abbandoni non accennano a diminuire. \n \n\n Tutta l\u2019Italia sta attraversando un periodo estremamente critico da cui tutti noi speriamo di uscire molto presto mettendo alla porta il virus.\n \n\n  Nel frattempo il ritmo di abbandoni e ritrovamenti in Sicilia, a Siracusa, non accenna a diminuire. Intere cucciolate abbandonate nei posti pi\u00f9 sperduti della citt\u00e0, cagne incinte vaganti, cani incidentali... tutto questo all\u2019ordine del giorno.  Istituzioni assenti, canili chiusi per esubero, pochi volontari rimasti che non hanno un rifugio costretti a pagare stalli di tasca propria per mettere in sicurezza i ritrovamenti.  Mi capita spesso sui social di leggere il nuovo hashtag #iostoacasa ma noi volontari non possiamo perch\u00e8 loro, i figli di nessuno, hanno bisogno di noi, adesso pi\u00f9 che mai.  In questo momento cos\u00ec critico chiediamo il vostro aiuto ! Non arrivano pi\u00f9 richieste di adozione ,la maggior parte dei \u00a0voli cancellati e quindi cuccioli che non potranno raggiungere le loro famiglie e da stasera dopo l\u2019annuncio di Conte la situazione non pu\u00f2 che peggiorare ulteriormente.\u00a0\n \n\n Una piccola donazione pu\u00f2 aiutarci a mantenerli inquesti lunghi mesi, la maggior parte di loro forse non avr\u00e0 mai un nome e una casa. Solo grazie a voi potremo salvarli e almeno garantire un posto sicuro lontano dalla strada, cibo e cure mediche.  \n \n\n Le donazioni ricevute verranno divise in parti uguali a volontari di Siracusa selezionati che \u00a0operano senza sosta nel territorio .",
